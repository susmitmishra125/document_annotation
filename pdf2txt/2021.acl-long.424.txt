abstract.
personalized news recommendation methodsare widely used in online news services.
thesemethods usually recommend news based onthe matching between news content and userinterestinferred from historical behaviors.
however, these methods usually have difﬁcul-ties in making accurate recommendations tocold-start users, and tend to recommend sim-ilar news with those users have read.
in gen-eral, popular news usually contain importantinformation and can attract users with differ-ent interests.
besides, they are usually diversein content and topic.
thus, in this paper wepropose to incorporate news popularity infor-mation to alleviate the cold-start and diversityproblems for personalized news recommenda-tion.
in our method, the ranking score for rec-ommending a candidate news to a target useris the combination of a personalized matchingscore and a news popularity score.
the formeris used to capture the personalized user inter-est in news.
the latter is used to measure time-aware popularity of candidate news, which ispredicted based on news content, recency, andreal-time ctr using a uniﬁed framework.
be-sides, we propose a popularity-aware user en-coder to eliminate the popularity bias in userbehaviors for accurate interest modeling.
ex-periments on two real-world datasets show ourmethod can effectively improve the accuracyand diversity for news recommendation..1.introduction.
personalized news recommendation is a useful tech-nique to help users alleviate information overloadwhen visiting online news platforms (wu et al.,2020d,b, 2021; ge et al., 2020).
existing personal-ized news recommendation methods usually recom-mend news to a target user based on the matchingbetween the content of candidate news and user in-terest inferred from previous behaviors (zhu et al.,2019; wu et al., 2019f).
for example, wu et al..figure 1: several example popular news..(2019e) proposed to model news content from newstitle based on multi-head self-attention.
in addi-tion, they modeled user interest from the previouslyclicked news articles with multi-head self-attentionto capture the relatedness between different behav-iors.
an et al.
(2019) proposed to use cnn networkto learn news embeddings from news titles and cat-egories, and model both long-term and short-termuser interests from news click behaviors.
however,these personalized news recommendation methodsusually have difﬁculties in making accurate recom-mendations to cold-start users, since the behaviorsof these users are very sparse and it is difﬁcult tomodel their interest (trevisiol et al., 2014).
be-sides, these methods tend to recommend similarnews with those users have read (nguyen et al.,2014), which may hurt user experience and is notbeneﬁcial for them to receive new information..the motivation for this work is that popular newsusually convey important information such as catas-trophes, epidemics, presidential election and so on,as shown in fig.
1. these popular news can attractmany users to read and discuss even if they havedifferent personal interest (yang, 2016).
in addi-tion, popular news are diverse in content and cancover many different topics (houidi et al., 2019).
thus, incorporating popular news has the potentialto alleviate the cold-start and diversity problems inpersonalized news recommendation..proceedingsofthe59thannualmeetingoftheassociationforcomputationallinguisticsandthe11thinternationaljointconferenceonnaturallanguageprocessing,pages5457–5467august1–6,2021.©2021associationforcomputationallinguistics54576.1 magnitude quake rattles alaskabiden aims to rebuild and expand legal immigrationreturning to normal is not simple for everyoneman accused of plotting walmart attack arrestedrussia diplomat warns us ahead of summitblack wall street was shattered 100 years agoin this paper, we propose a new method namedpp-rec for news recommendation1, which can con-sider not only personalized user interest in newsbut also the popularity of candidate news.
in ourmethod, the ranking score of recommending a can-didate news to a target user is the combination ofa personalized matching score and a news popu-larity score.
the personalized matching score isused to measure personal user interest in the con-tent of candidate news.
the news popularity scoreis used to measure the time-aware popularity ofcandidate news.
since news popularity is inﬂu-enced by many different factors such as contentand freshness, we propose a uniﬁed model to pre-dict time-aware news popularity based on newscontent, recency, and near real-time click-throughrate (ctr).
these two scores are combined via apersonalized aggregator for news ranking, whichcan capture the personalized preferences of differ-ent users in popular news.
moreover, we propose aknowledge-aware news encoder to generate newscontent embeddings from both news texts and en-tities.
besides, since news popularity can effectusers’ click behaviors (zheng et al., 2010) and leadto bias in behavior based user interest modeling,we propose a popularity-aware user encoder whichcan consider the popularity bias in user behaviorsand learn more accurate user interest representation.
extensive experiments on two real-world datasetsshow pp-rec can effectively improve the perfor-mance of news recommendation in terms of bothaccuracy and diversity..2 related work.
2.1 personalized news recommendation.
personalized news recommendation are widelyused in online news platforms (liu et al., 2010;bansal et al., 2015; wu et al., 2020d,c, 2019d).
ex-isting personalized news recommendation methodsusually rank candidate news for a target user basedon the matching between news content and user in-terest (wang et al., 2018; qi et al., 2020; wu et al.,2020a, 2019c).
for example, okura et al.
(2017)learned news embeddings from news bodies via anauto-encoder and modeled user interests from theclicked news via a gru network.
the matchingbetween news and user is formulated as the dotproduct of their embeddings.
wu et al.
(2019e)used multi-head self-attention networks to generate.
1https://github.com/julysinceandrew/pp-rec.
news content embeddings from news titles and gen-erate user interest embeddings from clicked news.
they also used the dot product of user and newsembeddings as personalized matching scores fornews ranking.
these personalized news recom-mendation methods usually model user interestsfrom previous news click behaviors.
however, it isdifﬁcult for these methods to make accurate recom-mendation to cold-start users whose behaviors arevery sparse (trevisiol et al., 2014).
these users arevery common in online news platforms, makingthe cold-start problem become a critical issue inreal systems (sedhain et al., 2014).
although somemethods were proposed to alleviate the cold-startproblem in personalized recommendation (sedhainet al., 2014; trevisiol et al., 2014), they usuallyutilized side information (son, 2016) such as socialnetwork (lin et al., 2014) to enhance user interestmodeling.
however, the side information used inthese methods may be unavailable in news recom-mendation.
in addition, these personalized methodstend to recommend similar news with those usershave already read, which makes it difﬁcult for usersto receive new news information and may hurt theirnews reading experience (nguyen et al., 2014; wuet al., 2019f).
different from these methods, in pp-rec we consider not only users’ personal interestin news but also the popularity of candidate news,which can alleviate both cold-start and diversityproblems to some extent..2.2 popularity-based news recommendation.
our work is also related to popularity-based newsrecommendation methods.
different from per-sonalized news recommendation methods whichrank candidate news based on users’ personal inter-ests, popularity-based news recommendation meth-ods rank candidate news based on their popular-ity (phelan et al., 2009; tatar et al., 2014; ler-man and hogg, 2010; szabo and huberman, 2010;jonnalagedda et al., 2016).
a core problem inpopularity-based news recommendation methodsis how to estimate the popularity of candidate newsaccurately.
most existing methods estimated newspopularity based on the statistics of users’ interac-tions with news on online news platforms, such asthe number of views and comments (yang, 2016;tatar et al., 2014; lee et al., 2010).
for exam-ple, yang (2016) proposed to use the frequencyof views to measure news popularity.
tatar et al.
(2014) proposed to predict news popularity based.
5458figure 2: the overall framework of pp-rec..on the number of comments of news via a linearmodel.
li et al.
(2011) proposed to use the numberof clicks on news to model their popularity andfurther adjust the ranking of news with same topicsbased on their popularity.
however, different newsusually have signiﬁcant differences in impressionopportunities, and these view and comment num-bers are biased by impression times.
different fromthese methods, we use ctr to model news pop-ularity, which can eliminate the impression bias.
besides ctr, we also incorporate the content andrecency information of candidate news to predictthe popularity of candidate news in a more compre-hensive and time-aware manner..3 methodology.
in this section, we introduce pp-rec for news rec-ommendation which can consider both the personalinterest of users and the popularity of candidatenews.
first, we introduce the overall frameworkof pp-rec, as shown in fig.
2. then we introducethe details of each module in pp-rec, which areshown in figs.
3, 4 and 5..3.1 framework of pp-rec.
in pp-rec, the ranking score of recommending acandidate news to a target user is the combinationof a personalized matching score sm and a newspopularity score sp.
the personalized matchingscore is used to measure the user’s personal interestin the content of candidate news, and is predictedbased on the relevance between news content em-bedding and user interest embedding.
the newscontent embedding is generated by a knowledge-aware news encoder from both news texts and enti-ties.
the user interest embedding is generated by a.figure 3: knowledge-aware news encoder..popularity-aware user encoder from the content ofclicked news as well as their popularity.
the newspopularity score is used to measure the time-awarepopularity of candidate news, which is predictedby a time-aware news popularity predictor basedon news content, recency, and near real-time ctr..3.2 knowledge-aware news encoder.
first, we introduce the knowledge-aware news en-coder, which is shown in fig.
3. it learns newsrepresentation from both text and entities in newstitle.
given a news title, we obtain the word em-beddings based on word embedding dictionary pre-trained on large-scale corpus to incorporate initialword-level semantic information.
we also convertentities into embeddings based on pre-trained entityembeddings to incorporate knowledge informationin knowledge graphs to our model..there usually exists relatedness among entitiesin the same news.
for example, the entity “mac”.
5459that appears with the entity “lancome” may indi-cate cosmetics while it usually indicates comput-ers when appears with the entity “apple”.
thus,we utilize an entity multi-head self-attention net-work (vaswani et al., 2017) (mhsa) to learn en-tity representations by capturing their relatedness.
besides, textual contexts are also informative forlearning accurate entity representations.
for ex-ample, the entity “mac” usually indicates com-puters if its textual contexts are “why do macneed an arm cpu?” and indicates cosmetics ifits textual contexts are “mac cosmetics expandsar try-on”.
thus, we propose an entity multi-headcross-attention network (mhca) to learn entityrepresentations from the textual contexts.
then weformulate the uniﬁed representation of each entityas the summation of its representations learned bythe mhsa and mhca networks.
similarly, weuse a word mhsa network to learn word represen-tations by capturing the relatedness among wordsand a word mhca network to capture the related-ness between words and entities.
then we buildthe uniﬁed word representation by adding its rep-resentations generated by the word mhsa and theword mhca networks..since different entities usually contribute differ-ently to news representation, we use an entity atten-tion network to learn entity-based news represen-tation e from entity representations.
similarly, weuse a word attention network to learn word-basednews representation w from word representations.
finally, we learn the uniﬁed news representationn with a weighted combination of e and w via anattention network..3.3 time-aware news popularity predictor.
next, we introduce the time-aware news popularitypredictor, as shown in fig.
4. it is used to pre-dict time-aware news popularity based on newscontent, recency, and near real-time ctr informa-tion.
since popular news usually have a higherclick probability than unpopular news, ctr canprovide good clue for popular news (jiang, 2016).
thus, we incorporate ctr into news popularityprediction.
besides, popularity of a news articleusually dynamically changes.
popular news maybecome less popular as they get out-of-date overtime.
thus, we use user interactions in recent thours to calculate near real-time ctr (denoted asct) for news popularity prediction.
however, theaccurate computation of ctr needs to accumulate.
figure 4: time-aware news popularity predictor..sufﬁcient user interactions, which is challengingfor those newly published news..fortunately, news content is very informative forpredicting news popularity.
for example, news onbreaking events such as earthquakes are usuallypopular since they contain important informationfor many of us.
thus, besides near real-time ctr,we incorporate news content into news popular-ity prediction.
we apply a dense network to thenews content embedding n to predict the content-based news popularity ˆpc.
since news content istime-independent and cannot capture the dynamicchange of news popularity, we incorporate newsrecency information, which is deﬁned as the dura-tion between the publish time and the predictiontime.
it can measure the freshness of news articles,which is useful for improving content-based pop-ularity prediction.
we quantify the news recencyr in hours and use a recency embedding layer toconvert the quantiﬁed news recency into an embed-ding vector r. then we apply a dense network tor to predict the recency-aware content-based newspopularity ˆpr.
besides, since different news con-tent usually have different lifecycles, we propose tomodel time-aware content-based news popularity ˆpfrom ˆpc and ˆpr using a content-speciﬁc aggregator:.
ˆp = θ· ˆpc+(1−θ)· ˆpr, θ = σ(wp·[n, r]+bp), (1).
where θ ∈ (0, 1) means the content-speciﬁc gate,σ(·) means the sigmoid activation, [·, ·] means the.
5460i-th clicked news predicted by the time-aware newspopularity predictor2 and convert it into an embed-ding vector pi via popularity embedding.
third,besides news popularity, news content is also use-ful for selecting informative news to model userinterest (wu et al., 2019a).
thus, we propose acontent-popularity joint attention network (cpja)to alleviate popularity bias and select importantclicked news for user interest modeling, which isformulated as:.
αi =.
exp(qt · tanh(wu · [mi, pi]))j=1 exp(qt · tanh(wu · [mj, pj])).
(cid:80)n., (2).
where αi and mi denote the attention weight andthe contextual news representation of the i-thclicked news respectively.
q and wu are the train-able parameters.
the ﬁnal user interest embeddingu is formulated as a weighed summation of the con-textual news representations: u = (cid:80)n.i=1 αi · mi..3.5 news ranking and model training.
in this section, we introduce how we rank the can-didate news and train the model in detail.
the rank-ing score of a candidate news for a target user isbased on the combination of a personalized match-ing score sm and a news popularity score sp.
theformer is computed based on the relevance betweenuser embedding u and news embedding n. follow-ing okura et al.
(2017), we adopt dot product tocompute the relevance.
the latter is predicted bythe time-aware news popularity predictor.
in ad-dition, the relative importance of the personalizedmatching score and the news popularity score isusually different for different users.
for example,the news popularity score is more important thanthe personalized matching score for cold-start userssince the latter is derived from scarce behaviorsand is usually inaccurate.
thus, we propose a per-sonalized aggregator to combine the personalizedmatching score and news popularity score:.
s = (1 − η) · sm + η · sp,.
(3).
where s denotes the ranking score, and the gate ηis computed based on the user representation u viaa dense network with sigmoid activation..we use the bpr pairwise loss (rendle et al.,2009) for model training.
in addition, we adopt thenegative sampling technique to select a negative.
2we remove news recency and content here to avoid non-.
differentiable quantization operation..figure 5: popularity-aware user encoder..concatenation operation, wp and bp are the train-able parameters.
finally, the ﬁnal time-aware newspopularity sp is formulated as a weighted summa-tion of the content-based popularity ˆp and the ctr-based popularity ct, i.e., sp = wc ·ct +wp · ˆp, wherewc and wp are the trainable parameters..3.4 popularity-aware user encoder.
next, we introduce the popularity-aware user en-coder in pp-rec for user interest modeling, whichis shown in fig.
5. in general, news popularity caninﬂuence users’ click behaviors, and causes biasin behavior based user interest modeling (zhenget al., 2010).
eliminating the popularity bias in userbehaviors can help more user interest from user be-haviors more accurately.
for example, a user mayclick the news “justin timberlake unveils the song”because he likes the songs of “justin timberlake”,while he may click the news “house of represen-tatives impeaches president trump” because it ispopular and contains breaking information.
amongthese two behaviors, the former is more informa-tive for modeling the user interest.
thus, we designa popularity-aware user encoder to learn user inter-est representation from both content and popular-ity of clicked news.
it contains three components,which we will introduce in details..first, motivated by wu et al.
(2019e), we apply anews multi-head self-attention network to the repre-sentations of clicked news to capture their related-ness and learn contextual news representation.
sec-ond, we uniformly quantify the popularity of the.

the loss function is formulated as:.

where spi denote the ranking scores of thei-th positive and negative sample respectively, andd denotes the training dataset..4 experiment.
4.1 dataset and experimental settings.
to our best knowledge, there is no off-the-shelfnews recommendation dataset with news popular-ity information.
thus, we built two datasets byourselves.
the ﬁrst one is collected from the userlogs in the microsoft news website from october19 to november 15, 2019, and is denoted as msn.
we use the user logs in the last week for evalua-tion and others for model training and validation.
the second dataset is collected from a commercialnews feeds in microsoft from january 23 to april23, 2020, and is denoted as feeds.
we use the logsin the last three weeks for evaluation and the restfor model training and validation.
for both datasets,we randomly sample 500k impressions for modeltraining, 100k impressions for validation, and 500kimpressions for evaluation, respectively.
the de-tailed statistics are listed in table 1. followingprevious works (wu et al., 2019a; an et al., 2019),we use auc, mrr, ndcg@5, and ndcg@10 toevaluate recommendation performance..# news161,0134,117,562.
# users490,52298,866.
# impressions1,100,0001,100,000.
# clicks1,675,0842,384,976.msnfeeds.
table 1: statistics of the datasets..in our experiments, word embeddings are 300-dimensional and initialized by the glove embed-dings (pennington et al., 2014).
the entity em-beddings are 100-dimensional vectors pre-trainedon knowledge tuples extracted from wikidata viatranse (bordes et al., 2013).
we use clicked andunclicked impressions in the recent one hour tocompute the near real-time ctr.
the recency andpopularity embeddings are set to 100 dimensionsand initialized randomly.
all multi-head atten-tion networks are set to have 20 attention headsand the output dimension of each head is 20. allgate networks are implemented by a two-layer.
dense network with 100-dimensional hidden vec-tors.
dropout approach (srivastava et al., 2014)is applied to pp-rec to migrate overﬁtting.
thedropout probability is set to 0.2. adam (kingmaand ba, 2015) is used for model training with 10−4learning rate.
hyper-parameters of pp-rec andbaselines are tuned based on the validation set..4.2 performance evaluation.
we compare pp-rec with two groups of baselines.
the ﬁrst group is popularity-based news recommen-dation methods, including: (1) viewnum (yang,2016): using the number of news view to measurenews popularity; (2) recentpop (ji et al., 2020):using the number of news view in recent time tomeasure news popularity; (3) scene (li et al.,2011): using view frequency to measure news pop-ularity and adjusting the ranking of news with sametopics based on their popularity; (4) ctr (ji et al.,2020): using news ctr to measure news popular-ity.
the second group is personalized news recom-mendation methods, containing: (1) ebnr (okuraet al., 2017): utilizing an auto-encoder to learnnews representations and a gru network to learnuser representations; (2) dkn (wang et al., 2018):utilizing a knowledge-aware cnn network to learnnews representations from news titles and entities;(3) naml (wu et al., 2019a): utilizing attentionnetwork to learn news representations from news ti-tle, body and category; (4) npa (wu et al., 2019b):utilizing personalized attention networks to learnnews and user representations; (5) nrms (wuet al., 2019e): utilizing multi-head self-attentionnetworks to learn both news and user representa-tions; (6) lstur (an et al., 2019): modeling users’short-term interests via the gru network and long-term interests via the user id; (7) kred (liu et al.,2020): learning news representation from titles andentities via a knowledge graph attention network.
we repeat each experiment 5 times and showaverage performance and standard deviation in ta-ble 2, from which we have the following obser-vations.
first, among the popularity-based newsrecommendation methods, the ctr method out-performs the viewnum method.
this is becausethe number of news views is inﬂuenced by impres-sion bias while ctr can eliminate the impressionbias and better measure news popularity.
second,pp-rec outperforms all popularity-based methods.
this is because these methods usually recommendpopular news to different users.
however, differ-.

table 2: news recommendation results of different methods.
we perform t-test and the results show that pp-recsigniﬁcantly outperforms other baseline methods at signiﬁcance level p < 0.001..ent users might prefer different news accordingto their personalized interests, some of which arenot popular and cannot be recommended by thesepopularity-based methods.
in contrast, hierec con-siders both popularity and personalization in newsrecommendation.
third, pp-rec outperforms allpersonalized methods.
this is because personal-ized methods usually recommend news based onthe matching between news and user interest in-ferred from users’ clicked news, and they ignorethe popularity of each news.
however, popularnews usually contain important and eye-catchinginformation and can attract the attention of manyusers with different interests.
different from thesepersonalized methods, pp-rec incorporates newspopularity into personalized news recommendation,which can recommend popular news to users andimprove the performance of news recommendation..4.3 performance on cold-start users.
we evaluate the performance of pp-rec and severalpersonalized methods on news recommendation forcold-start users.
we compare pp-rec with naml,kred, lstur and nmrs since they achieve goodperformance in table 2. we evaluate their per-formance on recommending news to users withk ∈ {k|k = 0, 1, 3, 5} historical clicked news.
inthe following sections, we only show experimentalresults on the msn dataset since results on msndataset and feeds dataset are similar.
as shownin fig.
6, pp-rec signiﬁcantly outperforms otherpersonalized methods.
this is because these per-sonalized methods usually recommend news basedon the matching between news and user interests.
however, it is difﬁcult for these methods to accu-rately model personal interests of cold-start usersfrom their scarce clicks and accurately help them.
figure 6: performance on cold-start users..ﬁnd their interested news.
different from thesemethods, pp-rec recommends news based on bothpersonalized interest matching and news popular-ity.
popular news usually contains important infor-mation and can attract many users with differentinterests.
thus, incorporating news popularity intonews recommendation can effectively improve thereading experiences of cold-start users..4.4 recommendation diversity.
in this section, we evaluate the recommendation di-versity of pp-rec and other personalized methods.
we use two metrics, i.e., intra-list average distanceand new topic ratio, to measure the diversity ofthe top k (k ∈ {k|k = 1, ..., 10}) recommendednews.
the former is used to measure the aver-age distance between recommended news basedon their representations, which is widely used inprevious works (zhang and hurley, 2008; chenet al., 2018).
the second one is used to measurethe topic similarity between recommended newsand users’ historical clicked news.
it counts thenumber of topics of the top k recommended news.
5463figure 7: intra-list average distance of news recom-mended by different methods..figure 9: effectiveness of personalized matching scoreand news popularity score..figure 10: effectiveness of different information usedfor news popularity prediction..figure 8: new topic ratio of news recommended bydifferent methods..which are clicked and are not included in topics ofusers’ historical clicked news.
besides, we use kto normalize the number.
fig.
7 and 8 show thatpp-rec can consistently improve the recommenda-tion diversity.
this is because these personalizedmethods recommend news to users based on thematching between news and user interest inferredfrom clicked news, making the recommended newstend to be similar to users’ consumed news.
differ-ent from these methods, pp-rec incorporates newspopularity into news recommendation.
besides thenews which is related to user interest, pp-rec canalso recommend popular news, which are very di-verse in content and topics, to users.
thus, pp-reccan enhance recommendation diversity..4.5 ablation study.
in this section, we conduct several ablation studieson pp-rec.
first, we verify the effectiveness of thetwo scores for candidate news ranking, i.e., newspopularity score and personalized matching score,.
by removing them individually from pp-rec.
theexperimental results are shown in fig.
9. we havetwo ﬁndings from the results.
first, after removingthe news popularity score, the performance of pp-rec declines.
this is because pp-rec incorporatesnews popularity into news recommendation via thisscore.
in addition, popular news usually containsimportant information and can attract many userswith different interests.
thus, recommending pop-ular news can improve news recommendation ac-curacy.
second, removing the personalized match-ing score also hurts the recommendation accuracy.
this is because this score measures user interestin news and incorporates personalized matchinginto news recommendation in pp-rec.
since userslike to click news related to their personalized in-terests, recommending users’ interested news caneffectively improve recommendation accuracy..next, as shown in fig.
10, we conduct an abla-tion study to verify the effectiveness of differentinformation in the time-aware news popularity pre-dictor by removing them individually.
we have sev-eral observations from the results.
first, removingnews recency makes the performance of pp-rec.

this is because news popularity usuallydynamically changes, and popular news will be-come unpopular once its information is expired.
since news recency can reﬂect the freshness ofnews information, incorporating it makes the newspopularity modeling more accurate.
second, theperformance of pp-rec without news content alsodeclines.
this is because after removing it, pp-recpredicts news popularity based on the near real-time ctr and recency.
however, it usually takessome time to accumulate enough impressions tocalculate accurate ctr.
thus, removing the newscontent makes pp-rec cannot effectively model thepopularity of news just published.
third, pp-recperforms worse without the near real-time ctr.
this is because near real-time ctr effectively mea-sures the click probability of the news based on thebehaviors of a large number of users in the recentperiod.
thus, removing the near real-time ctrmakes it pp-rec lose much useful information formodeling the dynamic news popularity..4.6 case study.
we conduct a case study to show the effectivenessof pp-rec.
we compare pp-rec with lstur sincelstur can achieve the best performance amongbaseline methods on the msn dataset.
in fig.
11,we list top 3 news recommended by two methodsto a randomly sampled user and their normalizedpopularity predicted by pp-rec.
we also list user’sclicked news.
first, we ﬁnd that the user clicked anews on football, which is recommended by bothlstur and pp-rec.
this is because the user haspreviously clicked three news on football, whichindicates the user is interested in football.
thus,both lstur and pp-rec recommend that newsbased on the personal interest of this user.
second,the user did not click other news on football rec-ommended by pp-rec and lstur.
this may bebecause recommending too much news with simi-lar information may make users feel bored, makingthe user only click a part of them.
this inspires us.
that recommending news with diverse informationmay help improve users’ reading experience.
third,the user clicked a news on crime, which is only rec-ommended by pp-rec.
this is because it is hard topredict user’s interests in criminal events from herclicks, making it difﬁcult for lstur to recommendthis news.
different from lstur, pp-rec recom-mends news based on both personal user interestand news popularity.
pp-rec successfully predictsthat this news is popular and recommends it.
thiscase shows that pp-rec can improve the recommen-dation accuracy and enhance the recommendationdiversity by incorporating news popularity..5 conclusion.
in this paper, we propose a new news recommen-dation method named pp-rec to alleviate the cold-start and diversity problems of personalized newsrecommendation, which can consider both the per-sonal interest of users and the popularity of can-didate news.
in our method, we rank the candi-date news based on the combination of a personal-ized matching score and a news popularity score.
we propose a uniﬁed model to predict time-awarenews popularity based on news content, recency,and near real-time ctr.
in addition, we propose aknowledge-aware news encoder to generate newscontent embeddings from news texts and entities,and a popularity-aware user encoder to generateuser interest embeddings from the content and pop-ularity of clicked news.
extensive experiments ontwo real-world datasets constructed by logs of com-mercial news websites and feeds in microsoft val-idate that our method can effectively improve theaccuracy and diversity of news recommendation..acknowledgments.
