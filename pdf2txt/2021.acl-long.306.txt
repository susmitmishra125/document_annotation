abstract.
discourse relations among arguments reveallogical structures of a debate conversation.
however, no prior work has explicitly studiedhow the sequence of discourse relations inﬂu-ence a claim’s impact.
this paper empiricallyshows that the discourse relations between twoarguments along the context path are essentialfactors for identifying the persuasive power ofan argument.
we further propose discocto inject and fuse the sentence-level structuraldiscourse information with contextualized fea-tures derived from large-scale language mod-els.
experimental results and extensive anal-ysis show that the attention and gate mecha-nisms that explicitly model contexts and textscan indeed help the argument impact classiﬁca-tion task deﬁned by durmus et al.
(2019), anddiscourse structures among the context path ofthe claim to be classiﬁed can further boost theperformance..1.introduction.
it is an interesting natural language understandingproblem to identify the impact and the persuasive-ness of an argument in a conversation.
previousworks have shown that many factors can affect thepersuasiveness prediction, ranging from textual andargumentation features (wei et al., 2016), style fac-tors (baff et al., 2020), to the traits of source or au-dience (durmus and cardie, 2018, 2019; shmueli-scheuer et al., 2019).
discourse relations, such asrestatement and instantiation, among argumentsreveal logical structures of a debate conversation.
itis natural to consider using the discourse structureto study the argument impact..durmus et al.
(2019) initiated a new study of theinﬂuence of discourse contexts on determining ar-gument quality by constructing a new dataset kialo..∗ this work was done when xin liu was an intern at.
huawei noah’s ark lab..figure 1: example of an argument tree from kialo.
stances, impact labels, and discourse relations are an-notated in orange, red, and violet respectively..as shown in figure 1, it consists of arguments, im-pact labels, stances where every argument is lo-cated in an argument tree for a controversial topic.
they argue contexts reﬂect the discourse of argu-ments and conduct experiments to utilize historicalarguments.
they ﬁnd bert with ﬂat context con-catenation is the best, but discourse structures arenot easily captured by this method because it is dif-ﬁcult to reﬂect implicit discourse relations by thesurface form of two arguments (prasad et al., 2008;lin et al., 2009; xue et al., 2015; lan et al., 2017;varia et al., 2019).
therefore, there is still a gap tostudy how discourse relations and their sequentialstructures or patterns affect the argument impactand persuasiveness prediction..in this paper, we acquire discourse relations forargument pairs with the state-of-the-art classiﬁerfor implicit discourse relations.
then we train abilstm whose input is the sequence of discourserelations between two adjacent arguments to pre-dict the last argument’s impact, and the perfor-mance is comparable to that of a bilstm on rawtext.
this indicates that a sequence of discourse re-.

based on thisintuition, we further propose a new model calleddiscoc (discourse context oriented classiﬁer)to explicitly produce discourse-dependent contex-tualized representations, fuse context representa-tions in long distances, and make predictions.
bysimple ﬁnetuning, our model beats the backboneroberta (liu et al., 2019) over 1.67% and pre-vious best model bert over 2.38%.
extensiveexperiments show that discoc results in steadyincreases when longer context paths with discoursestructures, e.g., stances and discourse relations, areprovided.
on the contrary, encoders with full-rangeattentions are hard to capture such interactions,and narrow-range attentions cannot handle com-plex contexts and even become poisoned..our contributions can be highlighted as follows:1. to the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrstto explicitly analyze the effect of discourse amongcontexts and an argument on the persuasiveness..2. we propose a new model called discoc toutilize attentions to imitate recurrent networks forsentence-level contextual representation learning.

2.1 overview.
kialo dataset is collected by durmus et al.
(2019),which consists of 47,219 argument claim texts fromkialo.com for 741 controversial topics and corre-sponding impact votes.
arguments are organizedas tree structures, where a tree is rooted in an ar-gument thesis, and each node corresponds to anargument claim.
along a path of an argument tree,every claim except the thesis was made to eithersupport or oppose its parent claim and propose aviewpoint.
as shown in figure 1, an argument treeis rooted at the thesis “physical torture of prisonersis an acceptable interrogation tool.”.
there is oneclaim to support this thesis (s1 in green) and oneto oppose it (o2 in fuchsia).
moreover, s1 is sup-ported by its child claim s2 and opposed by o1,and s3 holds the same viewpoint of o2..stance / impact.

as each claim was put in view of all its ances-tral claims and surrounding siblings, the audienceevaluated the claim based on how timely and appro-priate it is.
therefore, the context information is ofmost interest to be discussed and researched in thekialo dataset.
we deﬁne that a claim denoted as cis the argumentative and persuasive text to expressan idea for the audience, and a context path of aclaim of length l is the path from the ancestor claimto its parent claim, denoted as (c0, c1, · · · , cl−1)where cl−1 is the parent of c. for simplicity, wemay use cl instead of c without causing ambigu-ity.
the longest path of c starts from the thesis.
statistically, the average length of the longest pathsis 3.5..2.3 argument stance.
in a controversial topic, each argument claim ex-cept the thesis would have a stance, whether tosupport or oppose the argument thesis or its parentclaim.
in kialo, users need to directly add a stancetag (pro or con) to show their agreement or dis-agreement about the chosen parent argument whenthey post their arguments.
we use si to denote thestance whether ci is to support or oppose its parentci−1 when i ≥ 1. the statistics of these stancesare shown in table 1..2.4.impact label.
after reading claims as well as the contexts, usersmay agree or disagree about these claims.
theimpact vote for each argument claim is providedby users who can choose from 1 to 5. durmus et al.
(2019) categorize votes into three impact classes(not impactful, medium impact, and impactful)based on the agreement and the valid vote numbersto reduce noise.

3.1 argument impact from the perspective of.
discourse.
as paths under a controversial topic are stronglyrelated to comparison (e.g., contrast), contin-gency (e.g., reason), expansion (e.g., restate-ment), and temporal (e.g., succession) discourserelations (prasad et al., 2008), we model the dis-course structures from a view of discourse relations.
the ﬁrst step is to acquire discourse relation anno-tations.
bmgf-roberta (liu et al., 2020) is thestate-of-the-art model proposed to detect implicitdiscourse relations from raw text.
in the followingexperiments, we use that as our annotation modelto predict discourse relation distributions for eachadjacent claim pair..speciﬁcally, for a given argument claim cl andits context path (c0, c1, · · · , cl−1), we denotepdisco(cl) = (r1, r2, · · · , rl) as a discourse re-lation path such that ri ∈ r indicates the dis-course relation between ci−1 and ci when i ≥1.in this work, we adopt the 14 discourse re-lation senses in conll2015 shared task (xueet al., 2015) as r. and we also deﬁne the corre-sponding distributed discourse relation path tobe pdist(cl) = (d1, d2, · · · , dl) such that di =f (ci−1, ci) is the predicted discourse relation dis-tribution between claims ci−1 and ci (i ≥ 1) by apredictive model f. in experiments, f is bmgf-roberta1.
8 out of 14 relations appear in thepredictions, and the statistics of 7 frequent predic-tions are shown in table 2..as discourse contexts would affect the persua-sive power of claims, we ﬁrst discover the correla-tions between impacts and stances as well as cor-relations between impacts and discourse relations,illustrated in figure 2. from the label distribu-tion and correlations, we ﬁnd there are some cleartrends: 1) stances have little inﬂuence on argumentimpact, but discourse relations do.
correlations in-dicate that it is the contents instead of standpointsthat contribute to potential impacts; 2) it is a smartchoice to show some examples to convince others.
1the ofﬁcial open-source code is at https://github.
com/hkust-knowcomp/bmgf-roberta.
we trainsuch a classiﬁer on conll2015 shared task training data,and achieve 57.57% accuracy on the test set..figure 2: impact label distributions, the correlations be-tween labels and stances, and the correlations betweenlabels and discourse relations.
normalization is appliedto the columns..because instantiation is more relevant to impactfulthan any other relations; 3) similarly, explaining isalso helpful to make voices outstanding; 4) restate-ment is also positively correlated with impactful sothat we can also share our opinions by paraphrasingothers’ viewpoints to command more attention.
onthe contrary, chosen alternative is a risky methodbecause the audience may object..to investigate the role of discourse relations inimpact analysis, we design a simple experimentthat a single-layer bilstm followed by a 2-layermlp with batch normalization predicts the impactby utilizing the distributed discourse relation pathpdist(cl).
for the purposes of comparison and anal-ysis, we build another bilstm on the raw text.
each claim has [bos] and [eos] tokens to clarifyboundaries and we use 300-dim pretrained gloveword embeddings (pennington et al., 2014) and re-main them ﬁxed.
we set different thresholds forcontext path lengths so that we can control howmany discourse relations or contexts are provided.
from figure 3, discourse features can result incomparable performance, especially when longerdiscourse paths are provided.
instead, the modelwith raw text gets stuck in complex contexts..3.2 discourse context oriented classiﬁer.
it is generally agreed that the informative contextcan help understand the text to be classiﬁed.
how-ever, it is still unclear how to determine whether acontext is helpful.
one drawback of a broader con-text is the increasing ambiguity, especially in thescenario of the argument context path from differ-ent users like the results shown in figure 3. takeclaims in figure 1 for example, s1 and o2 givetwo different consequences to support or oppose.

table 3: different attention mechanisms.
the mem-ory attention freezes the historical representations sothat gradients of c i would not propagate to the mem-ory (c 0, · · · , c i−1)..3.2.1 adjacent claim pair encoding.
a difﬁcult problem in such an argument claim treeis the noise in irrelevant contexts.
a claim is con-nected to its parent claim because of a supportingor opposing stance, but claims in long distancesare not high-correlated.
based on this observation,discoc conduct word-level representations byencoding claim pairs instead of the whole contexts.
given a claim cl and its context path(c0, c1, · · · , cl−1), all adjacent pairs are coupledtogether, i.e., (c0, c1), · · · , (cl−1, cl).
we canobserve that each claim appears twice except theﬁrst and the last.
next, each pair (ci−1, ci) isfed into the roberta encoder to get the contex-tualized word representations.
c0 and cl are alsoencoded separately so that each claim has been en-−→h i to denote the encodedcoded twice.
we useword representations of ci when this claim is en-coded with its parent ci−1, or when it is computed←−alone as c0.
similarly,h i is the representationswhen encoding (ci, ci+1), or when it is fed as cl.
the encoding runs in parallel but we still use theterm phase to demonstrate for better understanding.
−→h 0. one particu-in 0-th phase, roberta outputslar relationship between a parent-child pair is thestance, and we insert the one special token [pro] or[con] between them.
it makes the sentiment andviewpoint of the child claim more accurate.
on theother hand, discourse relations can also inﬂuenceimpact prediction, as reported in section 3.1. how-ever, discourse relations are not mutually exclusive,let alone predictions from bmgf-roberta are notprecise.
thus, we use the relation distributions asweights to get sense-related embeddings over 14 re-lations.
we add additional w 1di for the parent andw 2di for the child except position embeddingsand segment embeddings, where di is predicteddiscourse relation distribution for (ci−1, ci), w 1and w 2 are trainable transformations for parents←−h i−1 andand children.
hence, roberta outputs−→h i with the concatenation of two claims, [ctx]ci−1 [sep] [cls] si ci [sep] in the i-th phase.
figure 3: performance of bilstm on discourse rela-tions and bilstm on raw text..the thesis.
and o1 objects s1 by a contrast con-clusion.
it is hard to build a connection betweenthe thesis and o1 if s1 is not given because it ischallenging to build a connection between “revealdesired information” with “interrogation tool” with-out a precondition “torture can help force prisonersto reveal information”.
on the contrary, thesis ands2 are still compatible as s2 is also a kind of result.
hence, a recurrent model with the gating mecha-nism that depicts pair-wise relations and passes tothe following texts makes more sense..lstm has gates to decide whether to remem-ber or forget during encoding, but it cannot handlelong-range information with limited memory.
re-cently, transformer-based encoders have shown re-markable performance in various complicated tasks.
these models regard sequences as fully connectedgraphs to learn the correlations and representationsfor each token.
people assume that transformerscan learn whether two tokens are relevant and howstrong the correlation is by back-propagation.
ta-ble 3 illustrates different possible ways to aggre-gation context information.
transformer (vaswaniet al., 2017) and bert (devlin et al., 2019) adoptfull-range attentions while transformerxl (daiet al., 2019) and xlnet (yang et al., 2019) regardhistorical encoded representations as memories toreuse hidden states.
sparsetransformer (childet al., 2019), in the opposite direction, stacks hun-dreds of layers by narrow the attention scope bysparse factorization.
information can still spreadafter propagations in several layers.
inspired bythese observations, we design discoc (discoursecontext oriented classiﬁer) to capture contextu-alized features by localized attentions and imitaterecurrent models to reduce noises from long dis-tance context.
as shown in figure 4, discocpredicts the argument impact through three steps..3961figure 4: the architecture of discoc.
si refers to the stance between c i−1 and c i, di is the discourse relationdistribution obtained from f(c i−1, c i).

[ctx], [cls], and [sep] are omitted in this ﬁgure..(i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , l}), where [ctx] is a special tokento indicate the parent claim and distinguish from[cls].
its embedding is initialized as a copy em-bedding of [cls] but able to update by itself.
and←−h l is computed by self-attention with no contextin the last phase.
in the end, each claim ci has two−→←−h i withh i andcontextualized representationslimited surrounding context information..3.2.2 bidirectional representation fusion.
←−h i} and {.
−→h i} fromas claim representations {roberta are not bidirectional, we need to com-bine them and control which of them matters more.
the gated fusion (liu et al., 2020) has been shownof a better mixture than the combination of multi-head attention and layer normalization.
we use it tomaintain the powerful representative features andcarry useful historical context information:.

where multhead is the multi-head attention opera-←−h i andtion (vaswani et al., 2017) whose query is−→h i, aj is the fusion gate for thekey & value isj-th word embedding, [· · · ] is the concatenation,(cid:12) is the element product operation, and w a andba are trainable matrix and bias for fusion gating..←−h i as the keythere are two reasons why usingof the multi-head attention: 1) [cls] exists in the−→←−h i while the replaced token [ctx] appears inh iwhen i (cid:54)= 0; 2) the position ids start from 0 when←−h i. the fused [cls] token embeddingcomputingui is selected to represent the whole claim..3.2.3 context path information gathering.
after extracting sentence-level claim representa-tions u0, u1, · · · , ul, a transformer layer is used togather longer-range context representations.
thetransformer layer includes a position embeddinglayer to provide sinusoid positional embeddings,a gated multi-head attention layer, a feed-forwardnetwork, and a layer normalization.
the positionembedding layer in discoc is different from thatin the vanilla transformer because it generates po-sition ids in a reversed order, i.e.
l, l − 1, · · · , 0.the reversed order is helpful to model the contextsof variable length because the claim to be classi-ﬁed has the same position embedding.
we alsochoose a gate to maintain the scale instead of usinga residual connection.
the gated transformer cangenerate meaningful representations because eachclaim can attend any other claims and itself.
on theother hand, it perfectly ﬁts the pair-wise encodingthat imitates the recurrent networks to reduce thenoise in irrelevant contexts and enhance the nearestcontext’s correlations.
for example, in figure 1,s2 is predicted as a result of s1 (with a probability.

consequently, s2 is high-relevant to the thesis as a potential result if “phys-ical torture is acceptable”, which can be capturedby discoc.
finally, a 2-layer mlp with batchnormalization is applied to vl of the last claim topredict its impact..4 experiments.
4.1 baseline models.
majority.
the baseline simply returns impactful..svm.
durmus et al.
(2019) created linguistic fea-tures for a svm classiﬁer, such as named entitytypes, pos tags, special marks, tf-idf scores forn-grams, etc.
we report the result from their paper..han.
han (yang et al., 2016) computes docu-ment vectors in a hierarchical way of encoding andaggregation.
we replace its bigru with bilstmfor the sake of comparison.
and we also extend itwith pretrained encoders and transformer layers..flat-mlms.
pretrained masked languages, e.g.,roberta, learn word representations and predictmasked words by self-attention.
we use these en-coders to encode the ﬂat context concatenation like[ctx] c0 [sep] [ctx] · · · [ctx] cl−1 [sep]as segment a and [cls] cl [sep] as segment b.after getting [ctx] and [cls] representations, agated transformer layer and a mlp predict impacts.
as for xlnet, we follow its default setting so that[ctx] and [cls] are located at the end of claims..interval-mlms.
flat-mlms regard the contextpath as a whole segment and ignore the real dis-course structures except the adjacency, e.g., dis-tances between two claims are missing.
we borrowthe idea from bert-sum (liu and lapata, 2019):segment embeddings of ci are assigned dependingon whether the distance to cl is odd or even..context-mlms.
we also compare pretrained en-coders with context masks.
a context mask is tolocalize the attention scope from the previous tothe next.
that is, ci can attends words in ci−1 andci+1 except for itself if 1 ≤ i < l; c0 can onlyattend c0, c1, and cl can only attend cl−1, cl..memory-mlms.
xlnet utilizes memory to ex-tend the capability of self-attention to learn superlong historical text information.
we also extendflat-mlms under this setting..4.2 model conﬁguration and settingswe use pretrained base models 2 in discoc andbaselines.
we follow the same ﬁnetuning setting:classiﬁers are optimized by adam (kingma andba, 2015) with a scheduler and a maximum learn-ing rate 2e-5.
the learning rate scheduler consistsof a linear warmup for the 6% steps and a lineardecay for the remaining steps.
as for bilstmand han, the maximum learning rate is 1e-3.
thehidden state dimension of linear layers, the hiddenunits of lstm layers, and projected dimensionsfor attention are 128. the number of the multi-headattention is set as 8. dropout is applied after eachlayer and the probability is 0.1. we pick the bestcontext path length l for each model by grid searchfrom 0 to 5 on validation data with the batch sizeof 32 in 10 epochs.
each model runs ﬁve times..4.3 argument impact classiﬁcation.
table 4 shows experimental results of differentmodels.
it is not surprising that neural models caneasily beat traditional feature engineering methodsin overall performance.
but linguistic features stillbring the highest precision.
we also observe a sig-niﬁcant 3.49% improvement with context vectorsaggregating in han-bilstm compared with thesimple bilstm.
this indicates that it is neces-sary to model contexts with higher-level sentencefeatures.
models with pretrained encoders ben-eﬁt from representative embeddings, and han-roberta achieves a gain of 5.49%.
flat contextpaths contain useful information to help detect theargument impact, but they also involve some noisefrom unrelated standpoints.
interval segment em-beddings do not reduce noise but make bert con-fused.
it is counterintuitive that the segment embed-dings depend on whether the distance is odd or evenbecause bert uses these for next sentence predic-tion.
since xlnet uses relative segment encodingsinstead of segment embeddings, interval-xnet isbetter than flat-xlnet in all three metrics.
on theother hand, context masks bring another side effectfor bert, roberta, and xlnet.
although thesemasks limit the attention scope at ﬁrst sight, distantword information is able to ﬂow to words with theincrement of transformer layers.
as a result, theuncertainty and attention bias increase after addingcontext masks.
the memory storing context repre-sentations is also not helpful.
the main reason is.

discoc always beneﬁts from longer discoursecontexts while other models get stuck in perfor-mance ﬂuctuation.
most models can handle onecontext claim, which is consistent with our ideaof pair-wise encoding.
discoc has consistentperformance gains; instead, other models cannotlearn long-distance structures better.

however, context-robertaand memory-roberta limit the attention scopeto the tokens of one previous claim, making mod-els unable to make use of long-distance contextinformation..figure 5: f1 scores of different models on varying themaximum path length..model.

we also remove either the stance token embeddingor the discourse sense embeddings from discoc.
the results in table 5 suggest that both sides ofstructures are essential for modelling the correla-tion between the parent claim and the child claim.
by comparison, discourse sense embeddings aremore vital..are gated transformers necessary?.
we add a gated transformer layer to gather sentence-level vectors.
such gathering is necessary for theproposed framework because each claim can onlyattend limited contexts.
bilstm and convolutionscan also be used for this purpose, so we replacethe gated transformer layer with a bilstm or aconvolutional layer.
moreover, we also removeit to make predictions by ul directly.
the resultsin table 5 show that the gated transformer is theirreplaceable part of discoc because it retains thecontextualized representations and remains theirscales.

thecase of not impactful is a little clearer, in the sensethat it has a unique relation chosen alternative asone of the most signiﬁcant patterns.
restatementalso appears frequently, showing neither generaliza-tion, nor speciﬁcation, nor paraphrasing of others’views can help make claims stand out..4.5 what makes claims impactful?.
high-coefﬁcient discourse relation patterns.
case study.
we use logistic regression to mine several inter-esting discourse relation patterns.
detailed settingsare described in appendix a, and results includingthe most high-coefﬁcient patterns are listed in ta-ble 6. we observe that some discourse relation pathpatterns are distinguishing for classifying individ-ual impact labels.
instantiation is a typical relationthat only occurs in the top patterns of impactful.
also, restatement is relatively frequent for impact-ful (5 of top 10), but it is the relation between thegrandparent and the parent.
providing additionalresources (restatement-result) or objecting others’repetitions (restatement-contrast) can increase thepersuasive power.
for the medium impact class, itstop 10 signiﬁcant patterns are the longest on aver-.
in appendix a, we deﬁne p r(r1, · · · , rl) asthe joint probability to generate the discourserelation path (r1, · · · , rl) given the context(c0, c1, · · · , cl−1) and the claim cl.
for exam-ple, the p r(reason, contrast) is 56.59% whichcorresponds to an impactful claim “there is no ev-idence for this” with its parent claim “our bodiesknow how to recognise and process current foods;changing them through genetic modiﬁcation willcreate health issues”.
furthermore, we ﬁnd 5 oftop 5 and 8 of top 10 are voted as impactful claimsafter sorting based on p r(reason, contrast).
for acomplex pattern restatement-restatement appear-ing in both top patterns of the impactful and thenot impactful, 3 cases with the maximum probabil-.
3965ities are not impactful while the following 7 casesare impactful.
it is interesting that the thesis ofthe top 3 claims is the same discussion about anamerican politician.
there are 25 impactful claimsand 22 not impactful claims in this topic, 24 ofwhich are restatements of their parent claims.
asfor restatement-reason, the most top pattern ofthe not impactful, we ﬁnd 7 of the top 10 claimsrelevant to politics, 2 of them about globalization,and one food-related.
therefore, there is no perfectanswer in these quite controversial topics, and thatis why restatement and reason appear frequently..empirical resultson the other hand, we check the performance oftesting examples to verify the effectiveness of thesediscourse relation patterns.
we choose the bestmodel of discoc, whose f1 score is 59.04% aswell as the best model of discoc (w/o discoe)whose f1 score is 58.06%.
we select testing ex-amples with speciﬁc discourse patterns, and perfor-mance differences are shown in table 7. discocbeneﬁts from 7 of the top 9 patterns and the perfor-mance margins are even more signiﬁcant than theimprovement of the overall results.
without giv-ing discourse relation patterns, the model still hastrouble capturing such implicit context inﬂuences.
empirical results support our idea that implicit dis-course relations could affect the persuasiveness..5 related work.
there is an increasing interest in computationalargumentation to evaluate the qualitative impactof arguments based on corpus extracted from webargumentation sources such as cmv sub-forumof reddit (tan et al., 2016).
studies exploredthe importance and effectiveness of various fac-tors on determining the persuasiveness and con-vincingness of arguments, such as surface texture,social interaction and argumentation related fea-tures (wei et al., 2016), characteristics of the sourceand audience (durmus and cardie, 2019; shmueli-scheuer et al., 2019; durmus and cardie, 2018),sequence ordering of arguments (hidey and mck-eown, 2018), and argument structure features (liet al., 2020).
the style feature is also proved tobe signiﬁcant in evaluating the persuasiveness ofnews editorial argumentation (baff et al., 2020).
habernal and gurevych (2016) conducted experi-ments in an entirely empirical manner, constructinga corpus for argument quality label classiﬁcationand proposing several neural network models..in addition to the features mentioned above, therole of pragmatic and discourse contexts has shownto be crucial by not yet fully explored.
zeng et al.
(2020) examined how the contexts and the dynamicprogress of argumentative conversations inﬂuencethe comparative persuasiveness of an argumenta-tion process.
durmus et al.
(2019) created a newdataset based on argument claims and impact votesfrom a debate platform kialo.com, and experimentsshowed that incorporating contexts is useful to clas-sify the argument impact..understanding discourse relations is one of thefundamental tasks of natural language understand-ing, and it is beneﬁcial for various downstreamtasks such as sentiment analysis (nejat et al., 2017;bhatia et al., 2015), machine translation (li et al.,2014) and text generation (bosselut et al., 2018).
discourse information is also considered indica-tive for various tasks of computational argumen-tation.
eckle-kohler et al.
(2015) analyzed therole of discourse markers for discriminating claimsand premises in argumentative discourse and foundthat particular semantic group of discourse markersare highly predictive features.
hidey and mck-eown (2018) concatenated sentence vectors withdiscourse relation embeddings as sentence featuresfor persuasiveness prediction and showed that dis-course embeddings helped improve performance..6 conclusion.
in this paper, we explicitly investigate how dis-course structures inﬂuence the impact and the per-suasiveness of an argument claim.
we presentdiscoc to produce discourse-dependent contex-tualized representations.
experiments and ablationstudies show that our model improves its backboneroberta around 1.67%.
instead, han and otherattention mechanisms bring side effects.
we dis-cover distinct discourse relation path patterns andanalyze representatives.
in the future, we plan toexplore discourse structures in other nlu tasks..acknowledgements.

the case of not impactful is a little clearer,in the sense that it has a unique relation chosenalternative as one of the most signiﬁcant patterns.
restatement also appears frequently, showing thatneither generalization, nor speciﬁcation, nor para-phrasing of others’ views can help make claimsstand out.
these interesting correlations betweendiscourse relation path patterns and argument qual-ity could be further analysis from the linguisticperspective in future works..a discourse relation path patterns.
to explicitly explore important high-order dis-course relation patterns, we model the processof yielding a concrete discourse relation pathpdisco(cl) = (r1, · · · , rl) as a generative process.
for a given context path (c0, c1, · · · , cl−1) andthe claim cl, we deﬁne the pattern set as all pos-sible patterns connected to cl.
mathematically, itis denoted as p = (cid:80)lis thecartesian product..lj=i r, where(cid:34)we assume that every ri ∈ pdisco(cl) is indepen-dent and identically distributed (i.i.d).
under thisassumption, the joint probability of a given path ofdiscourse relations (r1, · · · , rl) is.
i=1.
(cid:34).
p r(r1, · · · , rl) = πl.
i=1di[ri],.
(4).
where di is the discourse relation distributionbetween ci−1 and ci, di[ri] is the probabil-ity of a speciﬁc relation sense ri.
observingthe consistently increased performance of bil-stm on discourse relations in figure 3 whenl starts from 1 to 3 and no noticeable en-hancement with longer contexts, we analyzepath-generated distributions for up to three pre-vious claims.
we compute the joint proba-bilities p r(rl), p r(rl−1, rl), p r(rl−2, rl−1, rl) re-spectively and then concatenate these probabilitiesto get path pattern features x ∈ r(|r|+|r|2+|r|3)where each dimension of x corresponds to the prob-ability of a pattern belonging to p. next, the fea-ture vector x is fed into a logistic regression (lr)model to train a one-vs-rest binary classiﬁer foreach of the three impact labels..we report the largest top 10 coefﬁcients of con-verged lr models in table 6. some relation pathpatterns are shown distinguishing for classifyingindividual impact labels.
coefﬁcients vary differ-ently among different lrs except for restatement-restatement, which occurs in both impactful andnot impactful.
in general, instantiation is a typi-cal relation that only occurs in the top patterns ofimpactful.
also, restatement is relatively frequentfor impactful (5 of top 10), but it is the relationbetween the grandparent and the parent.
providingadditional resources (restatement-result) or ob-jecting others’ repetitions (restatement-contrast)can increase the persuasive power.
for the mediumimpact class, its top 10 signiﬁcant patterns are thelongest on average.
that indicates some views areusually considered ordinary in complex structures.
conjunction is the dominant relation (8 of top 10).
