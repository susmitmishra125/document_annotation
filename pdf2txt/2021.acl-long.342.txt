abstract.
although neural models have achieved com-petitive results in dialogue systems, they haveshown limited ability in representing core se-mantics, such as ignoring important entities.
to this end, we exploit abstract meaningrepresentation (amr) to help dialogue mod-eling.
compared with the textual input, amrexplicitly provides core semantic knowledgeand reduces data sparsity.
we develop analgorithm to construct dialogue-level amrgraphs from sentence-level amrs and exploretwo ways to incorporate amrs into dialoguesystems.
experimental results on both dia-logue understanding and response generationtasks show the superiority of our model.
toour knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to leveragea formal semantic representation into neuraldialogue modeling..1.introduction.
dialogue systems have received increasing re-search attention (wen et al., 2015; serban et al.,2017; bao et al., 2020), with much recent workfocusing on social chats (ritter et al., 2011; liet al., 2017) and task-oriented dialogues (wen et al.,2017; dinan et al., 2019).
there are two salientsubtasks in dialogue modeling, namely dialogueunderstanding (choi et al., 2018; reddy et al.,2019; yu et al., 2020) and response generation (liet al., 2017; budzianowski et al., 2018).
the formerrefers to understanding of semantic and discoursedetails in a dialogue history, and the latter concernsmaking a ﬂuent, novel and coherent utterance..the current state-of-the-art methods employneural networks and end-to-end training (sutskeveret al., 2014; bahdanau et al., 2015) for dialoguemodeling.
for instance, sequence-to-sequencemodels have been used to encode a dialogue history,before directly synthesizing the next utterance(vinyals and le, 2015; wen et al., 2017; bao et al.,.
figure 1: a conversation from dailydialog.
someimportant contents are marked with squares..2020).
despite giving strong empirical results,neural models can suffer from spurious featureassociations in their neural semantic representation(poliak et al., 2018; kaushik et al., 2020), whichcan lead to weak robustness, inducing irrelevantdialogue states (xu and sarikaya, 2014; sharmaet al., 2019; rastogi et al., 2019) and generatingunfaithful or irrelevant text (maynez et al., 2020;niu and bansal, 2020).
as shown in figure 1,the baseline transformer model pays attentionto the word “lamb” but ignores its surroundingcontext, which has important contents (markedwith squares) that indicate its true meaning, therebygiving an irrelevant response that is related tofood.
intuitively, such issues can be alleviatedby having a structural representation of semanticinformation, which treats entities as nodes andbuilds structural relations between nodes, makingit easy to ﬁnd the most salient context.
explicitstructures are also more interpretable compared to.

neural representation and have been shown usefulfor information extraction (strubell et al., 2018;sun et al., 2019; li et al., 2020; bai et al., 2021;sachan et al., 2021), summarization (liu et al.,2015; hardy and vlachos, 2018; liao et al., 2018)and machine translation (marcheggiani et al., 2018;song et al., 2019a)..we explore amr (banarescu et al., 2013) asa semantic representation for dialogue historiesin order to better represent conversations.
asshown in the central block of figure 2, amr isone type of sentential semantic representations,which models a sentence using a rooted directedacyclic graph, highlighting its main concepts (e.g.
“mistake”) and semantic relations (e.g., “arg0”1),it canwhile abstracting away function words.
thus potentially offer core concepts and explicitstructures needed for aggregating the main contentin dialogue.
in addition, amr can also be usefulfor reducing the negative inﬂuence of variances insurface forms with the same meaning, which addsto data sparsity..existing work on amr parsing focuses on thesentence level.
however, as the left block offigure 2 shows, the semantic structure of a dialoguehistory can consist of rich cross-utterance co-reference links (marked with squares) and multiplespeaker interactions.
to this end, we propose analgorithm to automatically derive dialogue-levelamrs from utterance-level amrs, by addingcross-utterance links that indicate speakers, identi-cal mentions and co-reference links.
one exampleis shown in the right block of figure 2, where newlyadded edges are in color.
we consider two mainapproaches of making use of such dialogue-levelamr structures.
for the ﬁrst method, we mergean amr with tokens in its corresponding sentencevia amr-to-text alignments, before encoding theresulting structure using a graph transformer (zhuet al., 2019).
for the second method, we separatelyencode an amr and its corresponding sentence,before leveraging both representations via featurefusion (mangai et al., 2010) or dual attention (cal-ixto et al., 2017)..we verify the effectiveness of the proposedframework on a dialogue relation extractiontask (yu et al., 2020) and a response generationtask (li et al., 2017).
experimental results showthat the proposed framework outperforms previous.
1please refer to propbank (kingsbury and palmer, 2002;.
palmer et al., 2005) for more details..methods (vaswani et al., 2017; bao et al., 2020;yu et al., 2020), achieving the new state-of-the-artresults on both benchmarks.
deep analysis and hu-man evaluation suggest that semantic informationintroduced by amr can help our model to betterunderstand long dialogues and improve the coher-ence of dialogue generation.
one more advantageis that amr is helpful to enhance the robustnessand has a potential to improve the interpretabilityof neural models.
to our knowledge, this isthe ﬁrst attempt to leverage the amr semanticrepresentation into neural networks for dialogue un-derstanding and generation.
our code is availableat https://github.com/muyeby/amr-dialogue..2 constructing dialogue amrs.
figure 2 illustrates our method for constructing adialogue-level amr graph from multiple utterance-level amrs.
given a dialogue consisting multipleutterances, we adopt a pretrained amr parser (caiand lam, 2020) to obtain an amr graph foreach utterance.
for utterances containing multiplesentences, we parse them into multiple amrgraphs, and mark them belonging to the sameutterance.
we construct each dialogue amr graphby making connections between utterance amrs.
in particular, we take three strategies accordingto speaker,identical concept and co-referenceinformation..speaker we add a dummy node and connect it toall root nodes of utterance amrs.
we add speakertags (e.g., speaker1 and speaker2) to the edgesto distinguish different speakers.
the dummy nodeensures that all utterance amrs are connected sothat information can be exchanged during graphencoding.
besides, it serves as the global root nodeto represent the whole dialogue..identical concept there can be identical men-tions in different utterances (e.g.
“possible” in theﬁrst and the forth utterances in figure 2), resultingin repeated concept nodes in utterance amrs.
weconnect nodes corresponding to the same non-pronoun concepts by edges labeled with same2.
this type of connection can further enhance cross-sentence information exchange..inter-sentence co-reference a major challengefor dialogues understanding is posed by pronouns,.
2compared with co-reference, identical concept relationscan connect different words which share the same meaninge.g.
(cid:104)could, might(cid:105) , (cid:104)fear, afraid(cid:105)..4431figure 2: dialogue amr graph construction process.
step 1: parse raw-text utterance into utterance amr graphs;step 2: connect utterance amr graphs into a dialogue amr graph..which are frequent in conversations (grosz et al.,1995; newman et al., 2008; quan et al., 2019).
weconduct co-reference resolution on dialogue textusing an off-to-shelf model3 in order to identifyconcept nodes in utterance amrs that refer tothe same entity.
for example, in figure 2, “i”in the ﬁrst utterance, and “sir” in the secondutterance refer to the same entity, speakr1.
weadd edges labeled with coref between them,starting from later nodes to earlier nodes (later andearlier here refer to the temporal order of ongoingconversation), to indicate their relation4..3 baseline system.
we adopt a standard transformer (vaswani et al.,2017) for dialogue history encoding.
typically, atransformer encoder consists of l layers, takinga sequence of tokens (i.e., dialogue history) s ={w1, w2, ..., wn }, where wi is the i-th token andn is the sequence length, as input and producesvectorized word representations {hln }iteratively, l ∈ [1, ..., l].
overall, a transformerencoder can be written as:.
2, ..., hl.
1, hl.
h = seqencoder(emb(s)),.
(1).
1 , hl.
where h = {hl2 , ..., hln }, and emb denotesa function that maps a sequence of tokens intothe corresponding embeddings.
each transformerlayer consists of two sub-layers: a self-attentionsub-layer and a position-wise feed forward network.
the former calculates a set of attention scores:.
αij = attn(hi, hj)..(2).
3https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref4for simplicity, we omit the coreference links between the.
second and third utterance for display..which are used to update the hidden state of wi:.
(cid:88)n.hli =.
j=1.
αij(w v hl−1.
),.
j.
(3).
where w v is a parameter matrix..the position-wise feed-forward (ffn) layer.
consists of two linear transformations:.
ffn(h) = w2relu(w1h + b1) + b2,.
(4).
where w1, w2, b1, b2 are model parameters..3.1 dialogue understanding task.
we take the dialogue relation extraction task (yuet al., 2020) as an example.
given a dialoguehistory s and an argument (or entity) pair (a1, a2),the goal is to predict the corresponding relationtype r ∈ r between a1 and a2..we follow a previous dialogue relation extrac-tion model (chen et al., 2020) to feed the hiddenstates of a1 and a2 (denoted as ha1, ha2) into aclassiﬁer to obtain the probability of each relationtypes:.
prel = softmax(w3[ha1; ha2] + b3),.
(5).
where w3 and b3 are model parameters.
the k-thvalue of prel is the conditional probability of k-threlation in r..given a training instance (cid:104)s, a1, a2, r(cid:105), the local.
loss is:.
(cid:96) = −logp (r|s, a1, a2; θ),.
(6).
where θ denotes the set of model parameters.
inpractice, we use bert (devlin et al., 2019) forcalculating ha1 and ha2, which can be regardedas pre-trained initialization of the transformerencoder..4432(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:1)raw utterance texts(b) utterance amr graphs(c) dialogue amr graphamrparsinggraph merges1s2couldihavemybill,please?s2certainly,sir.s1i’mafraidtherehasbeenamistake.whatcoulditbe?

3.2 dialogue response generation task.
given a dialogue history s, we use a standard auto-regressive transformer decoder (vaswani et al.,2017) to generate a response y = {y1, y2, ..., y|y|}.
at time step t, the previous output word yt−1 isﬁrstly transformed into a hidden state st by a self-attention layer as equations 2 and 3. then anencoder-decoder attention mechanism is applied toobtain a context vector from encoder output hiddenstates{hl.

n }:.
ˆαti = attn(st, hl(cid:88)n.i ),ˆαtihli ,.
ct =.
i=1.
(7).
the obtained context vector ct is then used tocalculate the output probability distribution for thenext word yt over the target vocabulary5:.
an amr is a directed acyclic graph g = (cid:104)v, e(cid:105),where v denotes a set of nodes (i.e.
amr concepts)and e (i.e.
amr relations) denotes a set of labelededges.
an edge can be further represented by atriple (cid:104)ni, rij, nj(cid:105), meaning that the edge is fromnode ni to nj with label rij..we consider two main ways of making useof dialogue-level amrs.
the ﬁrst method (fig-ure 3(a)) uses amr semantic relations to enricha textual representation of the dialogue history.
we project amr nodes onto the correspondingtokens, extending transformer by encoding se-mantic relations between words.
for the secondapproach, we separately encode an amr and itssentence, and use either feature fusion (figure 3(b))or dual attention (figure 3(c)) to incorporate theirembeddings..pvoc = softmax(w4ct + b4),.
(8).
4.1 graph encoding.
where w4, b4 are trainable model parameters.
thek-th value of pvoc is the conditional probability ofk-th word in vocabulary given a dialogue..given a dialogue history-response pair {s, y},.
the model minimizes a cross-entropy loss:.
(cid:96) = −.
logpvoc(yt|yt−1, ..., y1, s; θ),.
(9).
|y |(cid:88).
t=1.
where θ denotes all model parameters..4 proposed model.
our model takes a dialogue history s and thecorresponding dialogue amr as input.
formally,.
5similar to the encoder, there is also multi-head attention,a position-wise feed-forward layer and residual connections,which we omit in the equations..we adopt a graph transformer (zhu et al., 2019) toencode an amr graph, which extends the standardtransformer (vaswani et al., 2017) for modelingstructural input.
a l-layer graph transformer takesa set of node embeddings {n1, n2, ..., nm } and aset of edge embeddings {rij|i ∈ [1, ..., m ], j ∈[1, ..., m ]} as input6 and produces more abstract2, ..., hlnode features {hlm } iteratively, wherel ∈ [1, ..., l].
the key difference between agraph transformer and a standard transformer isthe graph attention layer.
compared with self-attention layer (equation 2), the graph attentionlayer explicitly considers graph edges when updat-ing node hidden states.
for example, give an edge(cid:104)ni, rij, nj(cid:105), the attention score ˆαij is calculated.
1, hl.
6if there is no relation between ni and nj, rij=“none”.

(12)m } denotes top-layer.
4.2 enriching text representation.
we ﬁrst use the jamr aligner (flanigan et al.,2014) to obtain a node-to-word alignment, thenadopt the alignment to project the amr edges ontotext with following rules:.
ˆrij =.
.
.

, n ]).
graph g(cid:48) = (cid:104)v (cid:48), e (cid:48)(cid:105), where v (cid:48) represents the set ofinput words {w1, w2, ..., wn } and e (cid:48) denotes a setof word-to-word semantic relations..inspired by previous work on amr graphmodeling (guo et al., 2019; song et al., 2019b;sun et al., 2019), we adopt a hierarchical encoderthat stacks a sequence encoder and a graph encoder.
a sequence encoder (seqencoder) transforms adialogue history into a set of hidden states:.
h s = seqencoder(emb(s))..(14).
a graph encoder incorporates the projected.
relations features into h s:.
ˆs = graphencoder(h s, emb(e (cid:48))),.
h.(15).
in addition, we add a residual connection be-tween graph adapter and sequence encoder to fuse.
word representations before and after reﬁnement(as shown in figure 3(b)):.
h f = layernorm(h s + h.ˆs)..(16).
where layernorm denotes the layer normaliza-tion (ba et al., 2016).
we name the hierarchicalencoder as hier, which can be used for bothdialogue understanding and dialogue responsegeneration..4.3 leveraging both text and structure cues.
we consider integrating both text cues and amrstructure cues for dialogue understanding andresponse generation, using a dual-encoder network.
first, a sequence encoder is used to transform adialogue history s into a text memory (denotedas h s = {hsn }) using equation 1.second, the amr graph g is encoded into graphmemory (denoted as h g = {hgm }) bya graph transformer encoder using equation 12..2 , ..., hg.
2 , ..., hs.
1 , hg.
1 , hs.
for dialogue understanding (figure 3(b)) anddialogue response generation (figure 3(c)), slightlydifferent methods of feature integration are useddue to their different nature of outputs.
dialogue understanding.
similar to section 4.2,we ﬁrst use the jamr aligner to obtain a node-to-word alignment a. then we fuse the word andamr node representations as follows:.
ˆhi =.
(cid:40)f (hsf (hs.
i , hgj ),i , h∅),.
if ∃j, a(nj) = wi,.
otherwise,.
(17).
where h∅ is the vector representation of the dummynode (see figure 2), f is deﬁned as:.
h = layernorm(h1 + h2)..(18).
the fused word representations are then fed into aclassiﬁer for relation prediction (equation 5).
dialogue response generation.
we replace thestandard encoder-decoder attention (equation 7)with a dual-attention mechanism (song et al.,2019a).
in particular, given a decoder hidden statest at time step t, the dual-attention mechanismcalculates a graph context vector cst and a textcontext vector cg.
t , simultaneously:.
ˆαti = attn(st, hsi ),ˆαtj = attn(st, hgj ),(cid:88)n.ˆαtihsi ,.

5.2 main results.

(20).
where w c and bc are model parameters..we name the dual-encoder model as dual..5 dialogue understanding experiments.
we evaluate our model on dialogre (yu et al.,2020), which contains totally 1,788 dialogues,10,168 relational triples and 36 relation types intotal.
on average, a dialogue in dialogre contains4.5 relational triples and 12.9 turns.
we reportexperimental results on both original (v1) andupdated (v2) english version.7.
5.1 settings.
(2020).
the same input format and hyper-we adoptforparameter settings as yu et al.
in par-the proposed model and baselines.
ticular,the input sequence is constructed as[cls]d[sep]a1[sep]a2[sep], where d de-notes the dialogue, and a1 and a2 are the twoassociated arguments.
in the bert model of yuet al.
(2020), only the hidden state of the [cls]token is fed into a classiﬁer for prediction, whileour baseline (bertc) additionally takes the hiddenstates of a1 and a2.
all hyperparameters are se-lected by prediction accuracy on validation dataset(see table 6 for detailed hyperparameters).
metrics following previous work on dialogre,we report macro f1 score on relations in both thestandard (f1) and conversational settings (f1c; yuet al., 2020).
f1c is computed over the ﬁrst fewturns of a dialogue where two arguments are ﬁrstmentioned..table 1 shows the results of different systems ondialogre.
we compare the proposed model withtwo bert-based approches, bert and berts.
based on bert, berts (yu et al., 2020) high-lights speaker information by replacing speakerarguments with special tokens.
for complete-ness, we also include recent methods, such asaggcn (guo et al., 2019), lsr (nan et al., 2020)and dhgat (chen et al., 2020).
bertc and hier,dual represent our baseline and the proposedmodels, respectively..by incorporating speaker information, bertsgives the best performance among the previoussystem.
our bertc baseline outperforms bertsby a large margin, as bertc additionally considersargument representations for classiﬁcation.
hiersigniﬁcantly (p < 0.01)8 outperforms bertc in allsettings, with 1.4 points of improvement in termsof f1 score on average.
a similar trend is observedunder f1c.
this shows that semantic information inamr is beneﬁcial to dialogue relation extraction,since amr highlights core entities and semanticrelations between them.
dual obtains slightlybetter results than hier, which shows effect ofseparately encoding a semantic structure..finally, the standard deviation values of bothdual and hier are lower than the baselines.
this indicates that our approaches are more robustregarding model initialization..5.3.impact of argument distance.
we split the dialogues of the dialogre (v2) devsetinto ﬁve groups by the utterance-based distancebetween two arguments.
as shown in figure 4,dual gives better results than bertc except when.

8we use pair-wised t-test..4435figure 4: the performance of bertc (baseline) anddual (ours) regarding argument distances..the argument distance is less than 5. in particular,dual surpasses bertc by a large margin whenthe arguments distance is greater than 20. thecomparison indicates that amr can help a model tobetter handle long-term dependencies by improvingthe entity recall.
in addition to utterance distance,we also consider word distance and observe asimilar trend (as shown in appendix 7)..5.4 case study.
figure 5 shows a conversation between a managerand an employee who might have taken a leave.
the baseline model incorrectly predicts that therelation between two interlocutors is parent andchild.
it might be inﬂuenced by the last sentencein the conversation, assuming that it is a dialoguebetween family members.
however, the proposedmodel successful predicts the interlocutors’ re-lation, suggesting it can extract global semanticinformation in the dialogue from a comprehensiveperspective..6 response generation experiments.
we conduct experiments on the dailydialog bench-mark (li et al., 2017), which contains 13,119 dailymulti-turn conversations.
on average, the numberof turns for each dialogue is 7.9, and each utterancehas 14.6 tokens..figure 5: case study for dialogue relation extraction..model.

table 4: ablation study on the development sets of bothdialogre (v2) and dailydialog..among the previous systems, plato andplato w/o l report the best performances.
ourtransformer baseline is highly competitive in termsof bleu and distinct scores.
compared with thetransformer baseline, both dual and hier showbetter numbers regarding bleu and distinct, andthe gains of both models are signiﬁcant (p < 0.01).
this indicates that semantic information in amrgraphs is useful for dialogue response generation.
in particular, the gains come from better recallof the important entities and their relations in adialogue history, which can leads to generating amore detailed response..6.3 human evaluation results.
we conduct human evaluation on randomly se-lected 50 dialogues and corresponding generatedresponses of the baseline and our models.
asshown in table 3, the transformer baseline givesthe lowest scores, while dual sees the highestscores from all aspects.
our main advantage is onthe coherence, meaning that amrs are effective onrecalling important concepts and relations.
as theresult, it makes it easier for our models to generatecoherent replies.
examples are shown in figure 8in appendix.
comparatively, all systems achievehigh scores regarding fluency, suggesting that thisaspect is not the current bottleneck for responsegeneration..7 analysis.
this section contains analysis concerning the ef-fects of graph features, dialogue length and modelrobustness.
we use dual model for experimentssince it gives slightly better results than hier..7.1 ablation on amr graph.
table 4 shows the results of our best performingmodels on the two datasets regarding different con-ﬁgurations on the dialogue amr graphs.
we reportthe average f1 score for dialogre and the bleu-1/distinct-1 score for dailydialog.
first, usingutterance-level amr improves the text baselineby 1.2 points and 1.5 points with regard to f1 and.
figure 6: devset performance against dialogue lengths..bleu-1 scores, respectively.
this indicates thatthe semantic knowledge in formal amr is helpfulfor dialogue modeling..second, our manually added relations (in sec-tion 2) also leads to improvements, ranging from0.5 to 1.0 in bleu-1 score.
the speaker relation isthe most important for dialogue relation extraction,a possible reason is that dialogre dataset mainlyfocus on person entities.
also, co-reference rela-tions help the most in dialogue response generation.
the identical concept relations give least improve-ments among three relations.
finally, combiningall relations to build a dialog-amr graph achievesbest performance on both datasets..7.2.impact of dialogue length.
we group the devset of dialogre (v2) and daily-dialog into ﬁve groups according to the numberof utterances in a dialogue.
figure 6 summarizesthe performance of the baseline and the proposedmodel on dialogue understanding (du) and re-sponse generation (rg) tasks.
in dialogue under-standing, our model gives slightly better f1 scoresthan the baseline when a dialogue has smaller than12 utterance.
the performance improvement ismore signiﬁcant when modeling a long dialogue.
this conﬁrms our motivation that amr can helpto understand long dialogues.
in dialogue responsegeneration, our model consistently outperformsthe transformer baseline by a large margin on.

overall, theseresults are consistent with table 1 and 2, showingthat amr can provide useful semantic informationand alleviate the issue of long-range dependency..7.3 robustness against input.
recent studies show that neural network-baseddialog models lack robustness (shalyminov andlee, 2018; einolghozati et al., 2019).
we select 100instances from the testset of dialogre (v2) whereboth baseline and our model gives true prediction,before paraphrasing the source dialogues manually(see appendix b.3 for paraphrasing guidelines.)..
results on the paraphrased dataset are givenin table 5. the performance of baseline modeldrop from 100 to 94.5 on paraphrased dataset.
bycontrast, the result of our model reaches 98.5, 4points higher than baseline.
this conﬁrms ourassumption that amr can reduce data sparsity, thusimprove the robustness of neural models..8 related work.
semantic parsing for dialogue some previouswork builds domain-speciﬁed semantic schemafor task-oriented dialogues.
for example, in thepegasus (zue et al., 1994) system, a sentenceis ﬁrst transformed into a semantic frame and thenused for travel planing.
wirsching et al.
(2012)use semantic features to help a dialogue systemperform certain database operations.
gupta et al.
(2018) represent task-oriented conversations as se-mantic trees where intents and slots are tree nodes.
they solve intent classiﬁcation and slot-ﬁlling taskvia semantic parsing.
cheng et al.
(2020) designa rooted semantic graph that integrates domains,verbs, operators and slots in order to performdialogue state tracking.
all these structures aredesigned for speciﬁed task only.
in contrast, weinvestigate a general semantic representation forthe modeling of everyday conversations..constructing amrs beyond sentence levelthere are a few attempts to construct amrsbeyond the sentence level.
liu et al.
(2015) con-struct document-level amrs by merging identical.
concepts of sentence-level amrs for abstractivesummerization, and liao et al.
(2018) furtherextend this approach to multi-document summer-ization.
o’gorman et al.
(2018) manually annotateco-reference information across sentence amrs.
we focus on creating conversation-level amrs tofacilitate information exchange more effectivelyfor dialogue modeling..bonial et al.
(2020) adapt amrs on dialogues byenriching the standard amr schema with dialogueacts, tense and aspect, and they construct a datasetconsisting of 340 dialogue amrs.
however, theypropose theoretical changes in the schema forannotating amrs, while we explore empiricalsolutions that leverage existing amrs of thestandard schema on dialogues..amr parsing and encoding our work is alsorelated to amr parsing (flanigan et al., 2014;konstas et al., 2017a; lyu and titov, 2018; guo andlu, 2018; zhang et al., 2019; cai and lam, 2020)and amr encoding (konstas et al., 2017b; songet al., 2018; zhu et al., 2019; song et al., 2020;zhao et al., 2020; bai et al., 2020).
the former taskmakes it possible to use automatically-generatedamrs for downstream applications, while the latterhelps to effectively exploit structural informationin amrs.
in this work, we investigate amrs fordialogue representation and combine amrs withtext for dialogue modeling..9 conclusion.
we investigated the feasibility of using amrsfor dialogue modeling, describing an algorithmto construct dialogue-level amrs automaticallyand exploiting two ways to incorporate amrsinto neural dialogue systems.
experiments ontwo benchmarks show advantages of using amrsemantic representations model on both dialogueunderstanding and dialogue response generation..acknowledgments.

generation.
figure 8 represents a conversation between ahotel service and a guest who wants to book aroom, along with its ground-truth response andmodel-generated responses.
we can observe thattransformer’s output is general and not consistentwith dialogue history.
while proposed models’outputs can capture the core information “room”from the history, and are more relevant to the topic.
besides, the output given by proposed model issemantically similar to the ground-truth output, butusing novel words to response, indicating that themodel not only captures the simple dependencybetween input and output sentences, but also learnsdeep semantic information of the dialogue history..b.3 paraphrasing guidelines.
we ask annotators to paraphrase the dialoguesfollowing 3 guidelines:.
• do not change the original meaning.
• paraphrase the sentence by using different.
lexicon and syntax structures..• paraphrase the dialogue as much as they can.
we also ask a judge to evaluate whether theparaphrased dialogue (sentences) convey the samemeaning of the original ones..figure 7: performance against argument word distance..a model parameters.

in particular, we share the wordvocabulary of encoder and decoder for responsegeneration.
we implement our baselines and pro-posed model based on pytorch.

b.1.
impact of argument distance.
in addition to utterance distance used in figure 4,we also consider word-based distance as a metricto measure argument distance.
figure 7 shows f1scores of baseline and our model on 5 groups of testinstances.
it can be seen that our model gives betterresults than baseline system among all distanceslonger than 30. in particular, our model surpassbaseline by 8 points when argument distance islonger than 120..figure 8: case study for dialogue response generation..4444<30[30,60)[60,90)[90,120]>120argument distance (# tokens)6264666870f1baselineoursdialoguehistory:…speaker-1:we have new room rates, sir.
