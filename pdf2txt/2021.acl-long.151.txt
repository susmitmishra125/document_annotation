abstract.
text representation models are prone to exhibita range of societal biases, reﬂecting the non-controlled and biased nature of the underlyingpretraining data, which consequently leads tosevere ethical issues and even bias ampliﬁca-tion.
recent work has predominantly focusedon measuring and mitigating bias in pretrainedlanguage models.
surprisingly, the landscapeof bias measurements and mitigation resourcesand methods for conversational language mod-els is still very scarce: it is limited to only a fewtypes of bias, artiﬁcially constructed resources,and completely ignores the impact that debi-asing methods may have on the ﬁnal perfor-mance in dialog tasks, e.g., conversational re-in this work, we presentsponse generation.
redditbias, the ﬁrst conversational data setgrounded in the actual human conversationsfrom reddit, allowing for bias measurementand mitigation across four important bias di-mensions: gender, race, religion, and queer-ness.
further, we develop an evaluation frame-work which simultaneously 1) measures biason the developed redditbias resource, and2) evaluates model capability in dialog tasksafter model debiasing.
we use the evaluationframework to benchmark the widely used con-versational dialogpt model along with theadaptations of four debiasing methods.
ourresults indicate that dialogpt is biased withrespect to religious groups and that some de-biasing techniques can remove this bias whilepreserving downstream task performance..1.introduction.
pretrained language models and their correspond-ing contextualized representation spaces (peterset al., 2018; devlin et al., 2019) have recently beenshown to encode and amplify a range of stereo-typical human biases (e.g., gender or racial biases)(zhao et al., 2019; basta et al., 2019; liang et al.,2020a,b), much like their static embedding pre-.
decessors (bolukbasi et al., 2016; caliskan et al.,2017; dev and phillips, 2019; gonen and gold-berg, 2019; lauscher et al., 2020a, inter alia).
hav-ing models that capture or even amplify humanbiases brings about further ethical challenges to thesociety (henderson et al., 2018), since stereotyp-ing minoritized groups is a representational harmthat perpetuates societal inequalities and unfairness(blodgett et al., 2020).
human biases are in alllikelihood especially harmful if encoded in con-versational ai systems, like the recent dialogptmodel (zhang et al., 2020), which directly interactwith humans, possibly even taking part in intimateand personal conversations (utami et al., 2017)..given the increasing presence of dialog systemsand chatbots in everyday life, the body of workthat focuses on detecting and mitigating biasesin conversational systems is surprisingly limited(lee et al., 2019; liu et al., 2020a,b; dinan et al.,2020a,b), albeit some more research has recentlyemerged in the wider context of biases in general-purpose language generation models (qian et al.,2019; sheng et al., 2019; nadeem et al., 2020; yeoand chen, 2020).
most of these efforts 1) focuson a single bias dimension (predominantly genderbias), 2) operate on artiﬁcial data (i.e., not real-world dialog interactions), and – with the isolatedexception of liu et al.
(2020b) – 3) completely ne-glect to analyze the potential effects of debiasingon model performance in dialog (sub-)tasks (e.g.,dialog state tracking).
in this work, we aim to closeall these gaps by introducing redditbias, theﬁrst ’real-world’ data set for measuring and mit-igating biases in dialog models, together with anevaluation framework that couples bias measureswith downstream evaluation on dialog tasks..contributions.
the contributions of this workare threefold: 1) we construct redditbias, a re-source for multi-dimensional bias evaluation and.

unlikeother bias evaluation resources, redditbias iscreated from real-world conversations collectedfrom the popular online discussion platform redditand manually annotated for multiple societal biasdimensions: (i) religion, with two bias analysissubdimensions – (jews, christians) and (muslims,christians), (ii) race (african, american), (iii) gen-der (female, male), and (iv) queerness (lgbtq,straight); 2) along with the resource, we propose adialog-oriented bias evaluation framework: it cou-ples (i) a perplexity-based bias measure meant toquantify the amount of bias in generative languagemodels with (ii) performance measures on twoconcrete downstream dialogue tasks – dialog statetracking (dst) and conversational response gener-ation (crg).
such a setup allows to test whetherbias mitigation comes at the expense of deterio-rated downstream dialog performance; 3) finally,we adapt four bias mitigation methods from theliterature and proﬁle their debiasing and down-stream effects on conversational language mod-els with our evaluation framework.
acknowledg-ing the conversational nature of redditbias, weresort to the recently proposed dialogpt model(zhang et al., 2020) for our comparative evaluationstudy.
our experimental results indicate that (i)dialogpt is signiﬁcantly biased along two (out ofﬁve) bias evaluation dimensions and (ii) that someof the employed debiasing methods (see §4) man-age to reduce the bias, at the same time preserv-ing dialogpt’s conversational capabilities.
werelease redditbias together with all code onlineat: https://github.com/umanlp/redditbias..2 data set creation.
we ﬁrst describe the process of redditbias cre-ation, carried out in three steps: 1) creation of biasspeciﬁcations for multiple bias dimensions, 2) re-trieval of candidates for biased comments based onthe bias speciﬁcations, and 3) manual annotationof candidate comments for the presence of bias..2.1 bias speciﬁcations.
unlike prior work, which mostly focuses on oneor two bias dimensions, our study encompassesﬁve types of bias from four dimensions: (1) re-ligion (two different bias types), (2) race, (3)gender, and (4) queerness.
to measure or miti-gate a bias, one must ﬁrst formalize (i.e., specify)it.
to this end, we start from the concept of an.
explicit bias speciﬁcation (caliskan et al., 2017;lauscher et al., 2020a): an explicit bias speciﬁca-tion be = (t1, t2, a1, a2) consists of two sets oftarget terms or phrases t1 and t2 between which abias is expected to exist w.r.t.
two sets of attributeterms or phrases a1, and a2.
further, we opt forbias speciﬁcations that reﬂect the inequality be-tween groups in power, i.e., dominant groups, anddiscriminated groups, i.e., minoritized groups:1 foreach be, the set t1 consists of terms describinga minoritized group with (negative) stereotypicalterms in a1, while t2 consists of terms describing adominant group with (positive) stereotypical termsin a2.
we compile bias speciﬁcations as follows.
the two target lists t1 and t2 are created bymanually compiling small sets of near-synonymousexpressions that unambiguously refer to the minori-tized and dominant groups, respectively (e.g., fordimension religion and muslims as the minoritizedgroup, we compile t1 = {muslims, arabs, islamicpeople, islam, islamic culture}).
we then collectthe list a1 of stereotypical negative descriptors byengaging with sociological literature relating tothe minoritized groups (welch, 2007; shaw, 2012;black, 2015).2 finally, we create the correspond-ing list a2 of positive descriptors by looking for(loose) antonyms of expressions in a1 (e.g., if jew-ish people ∈ t1 are stereotypically greedy ∈ a1,we would then place generous into a2).
note thatdesigning bias speciﬁcations is a crucial step inmost of the current debiasing approaches and thatthere exists a trade-off between employing a biggerset of speciﬁcation terms and keeping the bias spec-iﬁcations clean.
in this work, we generally focuson smaller and more precise term sets.
we showpartial term lists from our bias speciﬁcations intable 1 and provide the full lists in the appendix..2.2 candidate retrieval.
starting from the compiled bias speciﬁcations, wenext retrieve candidates for stereotypical commentsfrom reddit using the pushshift api.3 to thisend, we generate query strings by coupling eachterm from the target set t1 identifying the minori-tized group with each term from the correspondingstereotypical attribute set a1 – this gives a query.
1we borrow the terminology (i.e., minoritized groups vs.dominant groups or groups in power) from the feminist dis-course (e.g., d’ignazio and klein, 2020).

table 2: example comments from redditbias for each bias type..set q = t1 × a1.4 we then run each query fromq against the api with a search period of 3.33years.
in a postprocessing step, we clean the re-trieved data by removing urls, user names, andextra white spaces and by lower-casing the com-ments.
we retain only the retrieved comments thatare shorter than 150 characters.
in many caseswe observed that, while comments as a whole arenot biased, the part of the comment that connectst ∈ t1 and a ∈ a1, if taken out of context, isbiased (e.g., “he just thinks all blacks are crimi-nals”).
to capture more biased phrases, we alsoextract a narrower context of +/ − 7 tokens fromthe target term t ∈ t1.
we then annotate for biasboth (1) the whole comment and (2) this narrowercontext window around the target term extractedfrom the comment (as a standalone text)..2.3 bias annotation.
the last step in the creation of redditbias ismanually annotating for bias both retrieved com-ments and their corresponding target word contexts.
4to increase the likelihood that retrieved comments doexpress the bias of interest, we couple t1 terms with correctforms of the verb to be (e.g., jews are instead of jews orhusband is instead of husband), as such phrases are morelikely to introduce a biased statement..
(i.e., phrases).
human annotators then assign abinary label indicating if a negative stereotypicalbias is expressed to each comment and each corre-sponding phrase.5 after an initial training of theannotators, we ﬁrst carried out a small calibrationstudy during which we reﬁned the annotation guide-lines6 and identiﬁed corner cases, e.g., commentsinvolving sarcasm or comments quoting an earlier(biased) comment.
we then split all the retrievedcandidate comments for all ﬁve bias types betweenthe three annotators (without overlap) and let themcarry out the annotation work.
table 3 reveals thetotal number of annotated and positive (i.e., biased)instances at the comment and phrase level for eachof the ﬁve bias types..finally, we measure the inter-annotator agree-ment (iaa) by letting an additional annotator7 la-bel 100 randomly selected candidates for biasedcomments (20 per each of the ﬁve bias types).

we did not observe signiﬁcant differences inagreement across the individual bias types.
for thepurposes of training and evaluating bias mitigationmethods (which we adapt from the literature forconversational lms in §4), we split the obtainedbiased phrases into train, development, and testportions; their sizes are also shown in table 3. wefurther show examples of comments labeled as bi-ased for all ﬁve bias types in table 2..3 evaluation framework.
we now describe our framework for bias evaluationin conversational language models (lms), whichcouples (1) a bias measure computed on the testportions of redditbias with (2) task-speciﬁc per-formance on downstream dialog tasks.
the latteraims to capture potential negative effects that debi-asing techniques may have on downstream dialogperformance of conversational lms..3.1 language model bias (lmb).
we estimate bias in conversational lms by measur-ing if (and how much) likelier the lm is to gener-ate a stereotypically biased phrase compared to acorresponding inversely biased phrase in whichwe replace t1 ∈ t1 with a t2 ∈ t2.
to thisend, we start from a bias speciﬁcation be =(t1, t2, a1, a2) and a set of the correspondingbiased phrases x(t1,a1) from the test portion ofredditbias related to this bias dimension.
weﬁrst build pairs of corresponding terms betweenthe {t1, t2} ⊂ t1 × t2.8 we list all pairs in theappendix.
we then follow the principle of coun-terfactual data augmentation (zhao et al., 2018)and for each biased phrase x(t1,a1) ∈ x(t 1,a1)(e.g., “everyone knows jews are greedy”) createa corresponding inversely biased phrase ˆx(t2,a1)(e.g., “everyone knows christians are greedy”).
let(x(t1,a1), ˆx(t2,a1)) = {(x(i)i=1 be.
(t1,a1), ˆx(i).
(t2,a1))}n.a set of n such counterfactual pairs.
our bias mea-sure relies on the signiﬁcance of mean perplexitydifferences between biased expressions x(i)(t1,a1) andtheir counterfactual counterparts ˆx(i)(t2,a1).
sincethe reliability of such signiﬁcance may be nega-tively affected by outliers (pollet and van der meij,2017), we ﬁrst reduce noise by removing pairs(t1,a1) or ˆx(i)in which either x(i)(t2,a1) have very highperplexity, i.e., if they are not within the interval∈ [(¯x + 3 · s), (¯x − 3 · s)], where ¯x is the mean per-plexity of the sample and s the corresponding stan-dard deviation.
finally, we quantify and report thebias effect as the t-value of the student’s two-tailedtest between two ordered sets of corresponding per-plexity scores – pp (x(t1,a1)) and pp ( ˆx(t2,a1))– obtained after eliminating the outlier pairs.
in thissetup, a negative t value indicates the presence of a(negative) stereotypical bias.
the bias is then sta-tistically signiﬁcant if the corresponding p-value ofthe test is within the given conﬁdence interval (inthis study set to α = 0.05)..3.2 performance in conversational tasks.
successful bias mitigation should ideally have nonegative effect on the downstream performanceof the lm in dialog tasks.
we therefore couplethe lmb evaluation (§3.1) with measures of per-formance on 1) the original (intrinsic) measure-ment of in-domain perplexity on reddit utterances(zhang et al., 2020), and two dialog tasks: 2) dialogstate tracking on multiwoz (budzianowski et al.,2018), and 3) conversational response generationon dstc-7 (yoshino et al., 2019)..language model perplexity (lmp).
followingthe original dialogpt evaluation, we measure theperplexity of the model – before and after we sub-ject it to the bias mitigation methods from §4 – onthe reference data set consisting of 6k examplesextracted from reddit by zhang et al.
(2020).9.dialog state tracking (dst).
resorting to oneof the central subtasks of task-oriented dialog, weevaluate the models’ performances on dst.
here,the goal is to maintain an accurate account of thedialog belief state (i.e., information slots and theirvalues provided by the user) at each turn of theconversation, combining the information from thecurrent user utterance and the conversation history(henderson et al., 2014; mrkˇsi´c et al., 2017).

1944evaluate the dst performance on the multiwoz2.0 data set (budzianowski et al., 2018).10 as inthe original work, dst is cast into a binary predic-tion task: given the dialog history and the currentuser utterance, predict for each slot-value combina-tion whether it should be part of the current dialogbelief state.
as input to dialoggpt, we concate-nate the tokens from (i) the previous system output,(ii) the current user utterance, and (iii) the multi-woz domain, the slot, and value tokens.
we couplethe dialogpt’s transformer with a simple feed-forward classiﬁer to which we feed the transformedrepresentation of the last input token.
we train thewhole model using the binary cross-entropy loss..conversational response generation (crg).
finally, like the original dialogpt paper, we evalu-ate the model – before and after bias mitigation – onthe sentence generation task from the dialog sys-tem technology challenge 7 (dstc-7; yoshinoet al., 2019).
the models receive (a) a conversa-tional input which includes k most recent precedingturns, and (b) facts – external pieces of texts con-taining knowledge relevant to the conversation, andare challenged to generate an interesting responsethat is relevant w.r.t.
the dialog history.
for sim-plicity, here we use only the conversational contextas input for dialogpt and ignore the facts.
start-ing from the transformed representation of the lastcontext token, we then simply ﬁne-tune dialogpt(transformer encoder plus the lm head) on thetrain portion of the dstc-7 data set via causal lan-guage modeling, generating the correct responsefrom the data set.
the multi-reference test portionof the data set, also created from reddit, has 5 gold(human) responses for each instance..4 bias mitigation methods.
for evaluating biases and benchmarking bias mit-igation effects on redditbias, we selected thewell-known dialogpt (zhang et al., 2020) as theconversational lm.
besides being one of the mostwell-known conversational lms, it is addition-ally suitable for evaluation with redditbias be-cause it was pretrained on reddit data.
we subjectdialogpt to several bias mitigation approaches,which we here adapt in order to make them appli-cable to conversational lms..10github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz/.

4.1 language model debiasing loss (lmd).
qian et al.
(2019) reduce the gender bias in recur-rent lms by extending the lm loss of the modelwith an auxiliary term which penalizes differencesin probabilities assigned to words from genderpairs, e.g., woman and man.
for each of the ﬁvebias types (§2) and their corresponding bias speciﬁ-cations be = (t1, t2, a1, a2), we manually com-pile a set of pairs p = {(t1i, t2i)}i ⊂ t1 × t2 forwhich an unbiased language model should assignequal probability to t1i ∈ t1 and t2i ∈ t2 at theposition of any occurrence of either t1i or t2i.
tar-get terms from both t1 and t2 may participate inmultiple pairs in p .11 let pt ⊂ p be the set ofpairs in which some target term t (from either t1or t2) participates.
at every position in which anyterm t from p occurs, we augment the lm losswith the following debiasing loss:.
llmd =.

(t1,t2)∈pi.
(1).
where ˆy is the predicted probability for a term, withthe probability distribution computed only over thereduced vocabulary consisting of terms from p .
for positions where any terms from p appears, theoverall loss is the weighted sum between the causallm loss llm and llmd:.
l = λlmllm + λdllmd ,.
(2).
with the ratio between hyperparameters λlm andλd regulating the trade-off between the languagemodeling capability and bias mitigation..4.2 attribute distance debiasing (add).
inspired by the debiasnet approach of lauscheret al.
(2020a), applied in the context of debiasingstatic word embeddings, we devise a debiasing lossthat aims to equalize the distance of terms from t1and t2 w.r.t.
the stereotypical attribute terms fromthe attribute set a1.
for each bias speciﬁcation, westart from the same set p = {(t1i, t2i)}i ⊂ t1×t2of manually created term pairs between the targetlists as in the case of lmd.
however, this timewe focus on occurrences of attribute terms a ∈a1.
at every position at which any of the termsfrom a1 appears, we augment the lm loss with the.
11e.g., for the bias type religion #2, we created the fol-lowing pairs: (muslim, christian), (islamic, christian), (islam,christianity), (arabs, americans), (islamism, christianity).
welist the pairs for all other bias types in the appendix..1945following debiasing loss:.
ladd =.
|cos(t1; a) − cos(t2; a)| ..(3).
(cid:88).
(t1,t2)∈p.
here, a is the transformed vector representation ofthe token a and t1 and t2 are vector representa-tions of t1 and t2 from the output lm layer (i.e.,output embeddings of t1 and t2),12 and cos de-notes the cosine similarity.
add forces the outputrepresentations of target terms from the dominantgroup (e.g., christian) to be equally distant to therepresentation of a stereotypical attribute for theminoritized group (e.g., dangerous) as the represen-tations of corresponding target terms denoting theminoritized group (e.g., muslim).
similar to lmd,for all occurrences of a ∈ a1, the ﬁnal loss is theweighted sum of llm and ladd, see eq.
(2)..4.3 hard debiasing loss (hd).
similar to bordia and bowman (2019), we nextdevise a loss based on the idea of hard debiasingfrom bolukbasi et al.
(2016).
we compute this lossin two steps: (1) identiﬁcation of the bias subspace,and (2) neutralization of the attribute words w.r.t.
to the previously identiﬁed bias subspace..(1) bias subspace identiﬁcation.
we start fromthe same set of manually curated target term pairsp as in lmd and add.
let t be the output vectorof some term t from the lm head.
we then obtainpartial bias vectors bi for pairs (t1i, t2i) ∈ p bycomputing the differences between t1i and t2i:bi = (t1i − t2i)/2.
we then stack the partial biasvectors bi to form a matrix c. the bias subspace bthen consists of the top k columns of v, obtainedvia svd of c (i.e., svd(c) = uσv(cid:62)), withk as the smallest number of singular values thatexplain at least 50% of the variance of the squaredfrobenius norm of the matrix c..(2) attribute neutralization.
in the second step,we neutralize the contextualized representations ofattributes a ∈ a1 with respect to the bias subspaceb computed in the ﬁrst step.
for each occurrenceof any a ∈ a1, we augment the language modelingloss llm with the following debiasing loss:.
lhd =.
|bj(cid:104)a, bj(cid:105)| ,.
(4).
k(cid:88).
j=1.
12for attributes and targets consisting of multiple subword.
tokens, we average their respective subword vectors..where (cid:104)·, ·(cid:105) denotes the dot product, a is the trans-formed vector of the input attribute token a, andbj denotes the j-th column of the bias subspaceb. the hard debiasing loss forces the transformernetwork of the language model to produce contex-tualized representations for stereotypical attributes(e.g., dangerous) that are orthogonal to k mostprominent bias directions.
again, like in lmd andadd, the total loss for some input token a ∈ a1is the weighted sum of the debiasing loss lhd andthe language modeling loss llm..4.4 counterfactual augmentation (cda).
in contrast to the previous three debiasing meth-ods, all of which introduce some type of additionaldebiasing loss, in cda (zhao et al., 2018) we mod-ify the input data on which we ﬁne-tune the di-alogpt via standard causal lm training.
the gen-eral idea is to break stereotypical associations ofthe model by duplicating each stereotypical (i.e.,biased) instance and then replacing the term de-noting the minoritized group with the correspond-ing term denoting the dominant group.
we againstart from the manually created set of paired termsp = {(t1i, t2i)}i ⊂ t1 × t2.
for each utterancein the training portion of redditbias which con-tains an association between t1i ∈ t1 and a ∈ a1(e.g., “that muslim is dangerous”) we create a cor-responding counterfactual utterance by replacingt1i with its pair t2i (e.g., “that christian is danger-ous”).
we then simply further ﬁne-tune dialogptby minimizing the causal lm loss llm on boththe original and counterfactual utterances..5 experiments and results.
in our experiments, we benchmark dialogpt, avariant of gpt2 (radford et al., 2019) pretrainedon reddit conversations with the objective to learnto generate responses that are coherent with thecontextual prompt.
the model is pretrained on adata set containing 147m comment-response pairsspanning the time period from 2005 to 2017. thecorpus on which dialogpt was trained had beenpreprocessed by removing offensive phrases froma large blacklist.
consequently, dialogpt is ex-pected to exhibit fewer societal biases than general-purpose language models.
we validate this withour evaluation framework based on redditbias..1946model.

for each debiasing run, we train for 2epochs, and optimize the parameters using adam(kingma and ba, 2015) with the following conﬁgu-ration: learning rate = 5 · 10−5, weight decay = 0,beta1 = 0.9, beta2 = 0.999, epsilon = 1 · 10−8.
inthe loss-based debiasing procedures (lmd, add,hd) we optimize the hyperparameters on the re-spective validation portion of redditbias, search-ing the following grid: batch size ∈ {4, 8, 16},gradient accumulation steps ∈ {1, 5, 8}, λlm ∈{0.001, 0.01}, and λd ∈ {10, 50, 100}..we train the downstream models for dst andcrg (§3) for a single epoch.

as shown in figure 1a, ac-cording to our stereotypical bias measure (lmb),the original dialogpt model still exhibits signiﬁ-cant bias along the dimension of religion, for bothreligion #1 (jews, christians), and religion #2(muslims, christians), despite the reported heuristicremoval of offensive language from the pretrainingdata (zhang et al., 2020).
this is most likely dueto the more subtle nature of religious stereotypes,which manifest themselves not only in openly of-fensive text but also in latent co-occurrences oftarget and attribute terms (e.g., islam being radi-cal or jews playing violins).
the bias effect forthe gender dimension is also in the stereotypicaldirection (i.e., the t-value is negative), but the ef-fect size is insigniﬁcant.
for race and queerness,dialogpt exhibits insigniﬁcant bias effects in thedirection opposite from the stereotypical one.
webelieve that the biases in these two dimensions aremost frequently associated with explicit and offen-sive language, much of which was eliminated indialogpt’s preprocessing..for the two religion bias types, in which di-alogpt exhibits signiﬁcant biases, only two of thefour debiasing methods – hd and cda – are ableto remove the stereotypical bias for both bias speci-ﬁcations statistically signiﬁcantly.
lmd and addeach make the bias insigniﬁcant only in one of twocases (lmd for religion #2, add for religion #1),although they do attenuate the original bias effectfor the other speciﬁcation as well..interestingly, for the dimensions in which di-alogpt does not exhibit signiﬁcant stereotypicalbias in the ﬁrst place (race, gender, orientation),all four debiasing methods tend to lead to an anti-stereotypical bias effect, i.e., to more strongly (andin a few cases statistically signiﬁcantly) associatednegative stereotypical attributes with the dominantgroup.
for example, criminal gets associated withcaucasian, nurse with father or sinful with hetero-sexual).

encourag-ingly, none of the four debiasing methods in ourstudy seem to diminish dialogpt’s capabilities indownstream dialog tasks – dst and response gen-eration (see tables 4 and 5).15 interestingly, whilelmd drastically increases the perplexity on redditutterances (figure 1b; see lmp in §3) this does nothave negative consequences on dst and crg..to summarize, from the benchmarked debiasingmethods, hd and cda are able to signiﬁcantlyreduce the bias and preserve conversational capa-bilities; our results suggest that the dialog perfor-mance would remain unaffected even if hd andcda are to be applied more than once, in order tomitigate multiple bias types..6 related work.

subsequentwork proposed extensions to further embeddingmodels (liang et al., 2020a,b) and languages (e.g.,mccurdy and serbetci, 2020; lauscher and glavaˇs,2019; lauscher et al., 2020b; may et al., 2019),analyses of the proposed measures (e.g., gonenand goldberg, 2019; ethayarajh et al., 2019), morecomprehensive evaluation frameworks (lauscheret al., 2020a), new debiasing approaches (dev andphillips, 2019; karve et al., 2019) and task-speciﬁcbias measures and resources for tasks like corefer-ence resolution (zhao et al., 2018), machine trans-lation (stanovsky et al., 2019) and natural languageinference (dev et al., 2020).
in our work, we simi-larly acknowledge the importance of understandingbias w.r.t.

stereotypical societal biases may lead to the gen-eration of unfair and unethical responses in dialogsystems.
we presented redditbias, a compre-hensive resource for bias evaluation and debiasingof conversational lms.
consisting of manually-annotated biased comments from reddit, reddit-bias is the ﬁrst real-world resource dedicated tomulti-dimensional analysis (gender, race, religion,queerness) of biases in dialog models.
we bench-marked the well-known dialoggpt on reddit-bias and analyzed the effects that different debias-ing methods (adapted from previous work) have on.
it.
despite dedicated bias mitigation preprocessingof dialoggpt’s pretraining data, it still exhibitsprominent religious biases.
the benchmarked debi-asing methods, however, mostly manage to mitigatethose biases, while at the same time retaining themodel performance in dialog-oriented downstreamtasks (e.g., dialog state tracking).
we hope thatredditbias catalyzes research efforts on fair andethical dialog systems and conversational ai..acknowledgments.

we capture gender identities beyond thebinary conception in our lgbtq bias speciﬁcationunder the notion of queerness..(ii) similarly important is the intersectional-ity (crenshaw, 1989) of stereotyping due to theindividual composition and interaction of iden-tity chracteristics, e.g., social class and gen-der (degaetano-ortlieb, 2018).
due to its com-plexity, we do not address the topic in this work..(iii) as we demonstrate in our work, debiasingtechnologies can, beyond its intended use, be usedto increase bias and create biased models.

b annotation guidelines.
general task description.
given a csv ﬁlewith sentences and phrases relating to a particulardemographic group, decide whether these texts arebiased or unbiased w.r.t given target terms (wordsreferring to demographic group, e.g., ’african’(racial bias)) and attribute terms (presumably bi-ased words, e.g., ’thug’ (racial bias))).
note thata phrase can be biased while a sentence is not andvice versa..csv structure.

example annotation.
example 1:.
sentence: “statistically black people are responsible for ofviolent crime in the us while only making up of the populationthat also plays a factor.” – annotation = 1 (i.e., biased).
phrase: “statistically black people are responsible for ofviolent crime” – annotation = 1 (i.e.
biased).
in the above example both sentence and phrase arebiased towards a demographic group, as both implythat black people are violent..example 2:.
sentence: “not all muslims are terrorists but all terrorists aremuslim.
do you see now how stupid you sound?” – annotation= 0 (i.e., unbiased).
phrase: “not all muslims are terrorists but all terrorists aremuslim.” – annotation = 1 (i.e.
biased).
in the above example sentence is unbiased towardsmuslims as the speaker is discouraging someoneelse from being biased.
although the phrase isbiased as ’do you see now how stupid you sound?’is cropped out..if any sentence or phrase is difﬁcult to be.
