abstract.
humans are increasingly interacting with ma-chines through language, sometimes in con-texts where the user may not know they aretalking to a machine (like over the phone ora text chatbot).
we aim to understand howsystem designers and researchers might allowtheir systems to conﬁrm its non-human iden-tity.
we collect over 2,500 phrasings relatedto the intent of “are you a robot?".
this ispaired with over 2,500 adversarially selectedutterances where only conﬁrming the systemis non-human would be insufﬁcient or disﬂu-ent.
we compare classiﬁers to recognize the in-tent and discuss the precision/recall and modelcomplexity tradeoffs.
such classiﬁers couldbe integrated into dialog systems to avoidundesired deception.
we then explore howboth a generative research model (blender) aswell as two deployed systems (amazon alexa,google assistant) handle this intent, ﬁndingthat systems often fail to conﬁrm their non-human identity.
finally, we try to understandwhat a good response to the intent would be,and conduct a user study to compare the im-portant aspects when responding to this intent..alizing they are talking to a machine.
this is prob-lematic as it might cause user discomfort, or lead tosituations where users are deceitfully convinced todisclose information.
in addition, a 2018 californiabill made it unlawful for a bot to mislead peopleabout its artiﬁcial identity for commercial trans-actions or to inﬂuence an election vote (legisla-ture, 2018).
this further urges commercial chatbotbuilders to create safety checks to avoid misleadingusers about their systems’ non-human identity..a basic ﬁrst step in avoiding deception is allow-ing systems to recognize when the user explicitlyasks if they are interacting with a human or a con-versational system (an “are you a robot?"
intent)..there are reasons to think this might be difﬁcult.
for one, there are varied number of ways to conveythis intent:.
when recognizing this intent, certain utterances.
might fool simple approaches as false positives:.
1.introduction.
the ways humans use language systems is rapidlygrowing.
there are tens of thousands of chatbotson platforms like facebook messenger and mi-crosoft’s skype (brandtzaeg and følstad, 2017),and millions of smart speakers in homes (olsonand kemery, 2019).
additionally, systems suchas google’s duplex (leviathan and matias, 2018),which phone calls businesses to make reservations,foreshadows a future where users might have un-solicited conversations with human sounding ma-chines over the phone..this future creates many challenges (følstad andbrandtzæg, 2017; henderson et al., 2018).
a classof these problems have to do with humans not re-.
additionally, current trends suggests progress indialog systems might come from training on mas-sive amounts of human conversation data (zhanget al., 2020; roller et al., 2020; adiwardana et al.,2020).
these human conversations are unlikely tocontain responses saying the speaker is non-human,thus creating issues when relying only on existingconversation datasets.
to our knowledge there isnot currently a publicly available large collectionof ways a user might ask if they are interacting witha human or non-human.
creating such dataset can.

ing research questions:.
rq1.
how can a user asking “are you a robot?"
be accurately detected?
if accurate detection ispossible, a classiﬁer could be incorporated intodownstream systems.

rq2.
how can we characterize existing lan-systems handling the user askingguagewhether they are interacting with a robot?
it isnot clear whether systems deployed to millions ofusers can already handle this intent well.
§5.
rq3.
how do including components of a systemresponse to “are you a robot” affect human per-ception of the system?
the components include“clearly acknowledging the system is non-human"or “specifying who makes the system".

2 related work.
mindless anthropomorphism: humans natu-rally might perceive machines as human-like.
thiscan be caused by user attempts to understand thesesystems, especially as machines enter historicallyhuman-only domains (nass and moon, 2000; ep-ley et al., 2007; salles et al., 2020).
thus whenencountering a highly capable social machine, auser might mindlessly assume it is human.
dishonest anthropomorphism: the term “dis-honest anthropomorphism" refers to machines be-ing designed to falsely give off signals of being hu-man in order to exploit ingrained human reactionsto appearance and behavior (kaminski et al., 2016;leong and selinger, 2019).
for example kaminskiet al.
(2016) imagine a scenario where a machinegives the appearance of covering it’s eyes, but yetcontinues to observe the environment using a cam-era in its neck.
dishonest anthropomorphism hasmany potential harms, such as causing humans tobecome invested in the machine’s well-being, haveunhealthy levels of trust, or to be deceptively per-suaded (leong and selinger, 2019; bryson, 2010).
robot disclosure: other work has looked howsystems disclosing their non-human identity affectsthe conversation (mozafari et al., 2020; ho et al.,2018).
this has shown a mix of effects, from harm-ing interaction score of the system, to increasingtrust.
that work mostly focuses on voluntary dis-.
closure of the system identity at the beginning orend of the interaction.
in contrast, we focus ondisclosure as the result of user inquiry..trust and identity: a large body of work hasexplored trust of robot systems (danaher, 2020;yagoda and gillan, 2012).
for example foehr andgermelmann (2020) ﬁnd that there are many pathsto trust of language systems; while trust comespartly from anthropomorphic cues, trust also comesfrom non-anthropomorphic cues such as task com-petence and brand impressions of the manufacture.
there has been prior explorations of characteriz-ing the identity for bots (chaves and gerosa, 2019;de angeli, 2005), and how identity inﬂuence useraction (corti and gillespie, 2016; araujo, 2018)..public understanding of systems: prior worksuggests one should not assume users have a clearunderstanding of language systems.
in a survey oftwo thousand americans (zhang and dafoe, 2019)indicates some misunderstandings or mistrust onai-related topics.
additionally, people have beenunable to distinguish machine written text fromhuman written text (brown et al., 2020; zellerset al., 2019).
thus being able to remove uncertaintywhen asked could be beneﬁcial..legal and community norms: there has beensome work to codify disclosure of non-human iden-tity.
as mentioned, a california law starts to pro-hibit bots misleading people on their artiﬁcal iden-tity (legislature, 2018), and there are argumentsfor federal actions (hartzog, 2014).
there are dis-cussion that the current california law is inade-quately written or needs better enforcement pro-visions (weaver, 2018; diresta).
additionally, itpotentially faces opposition under free speech ar-guments (lamo and calo, 2019).
outside of legisla-tion, some inﬂuential groups like ieee (chatila andhavens, 2019) and eu (2019) have issued norm-guiding reports encouraging system accountabil-ity and transparency.
implementing such laws ornorms can be aided with technical progress like ther-u-a-robot dataset and classiﬁers..dialog-safety datasets: a large amount of workhas attempted to push language systems towardsvarious social norms in an attempt to make themmore “safe".
a literature survey found 146 papersdiscussing bias in nlp systems (blodgett et al.,2020).
this includes data for detection of hatefulor offensive speech which can then be used as aﬁlter or adjust system outputs (dinan et al., 2019;paranjape et al., 2020).
additionally there efforts.
7000model to aspects of human ethics (hendrycks et al.,2020).
we believe that the r-u-a-robot datasetcan ﬁt into this ecosystem of datasets..3 dataset construction.
we aim to gather a large number phrasings of how auser might ask if they are interacting with a humanor non-human.
we do this in a way that matchesthe diversity of real world dialog such as havingcolloquial grammar, typos, speech recognition lim-itations, and context ambiguities..because the primary usecase is as a safety checkon dialog systems, we structure the data as classi-ﬁcation task with positive examples being userutterances where it would be clearly appropriateto respond by clarifying the system is non-human.
the negative examples are user utterances wherea response clarifying the systems non-human iden-tity would inappropriate or disﬂuent.
additionally,we allow a third “ambiguous if clarify" (aic) la-bel for cases where it is unclear if a scripted clariﬁ-cation of non-human identity would be appropriate.
the negative examples should include diversehard-negatives in order to avoid an overﬁtted clas-siﬁer.
for example, if the negative exampleswere drawn only from random utterances, then itmight be possible for an accurate classiﬁer to al-ways return positive if the utterance containedunigrams like “robot" or trigrams like “are you a".
this would fail for utterances like “do you likerobots?"
or “are you a doctor?"..
3.1 context free grammar generation.
to help create diverse examples, we specify exam-ples as a probabilistic context free grammar.
forexample, consider the following simple grammar:.
s → " a r e you a " robotorhuman |.
"am i.t a l k i n g t o a " robotorhuman.
robotorhuman → robotrobot → " r o b o t "human → " human ".
||.
| human."
c h a t b o t "" p e r s o n ".
|.
|."
c o m p u t e r "" r e a l p e r s o n ".
this toy grammar can be used to produce 12 uniquephrasing of the same intent.
in reality we use agrammar with far more synonyms and complexity.
specifying examples as a grammar allows both fordiverse data augmentation, and can be used for aclassiﬁer as discussed in section 4..3.2 crowd sourcing for expanding.
grammar.
we hand write the initial version of our examplegrammar.
however, this is biased towards a limited.
view of how to express the intent and hard nega-tives.
to rectify this bias we issued a survey ﬁrstto some internal colleagues, and then to amazonmechanical turk workers to diversify the grammar.
the survey consisted of four pages with three re-sponses each.
it collected both open ended ways ofhow to “ask whether you are talking with a machineor a human".
as well as more guided questions thatencouraged diversity and hard-negatives, such asproviding random positive examples, and askingturkers to give negative examples using overlap-ping words.
(for exact wording see appendix b).
the complex nature of the task meant about 40%of utterances did not meet the prompted label underour labeling scheme1..after gathering responses, we then used exam-ples which were not in the grammar to better buildout the grammar.
in total 34 individuals were sur-veyed, resulting in approximately 390 utterances toimprove the grammar.
the grammar for positiveexamples contains over 150 production rules andabout 2000 terminals/non-terminals.
this could beused to recognize or sample over 100,000 uniquestrings2..3.3 additional data sources.
while the handwritten utterances we collect fromturkers and convert into the grammar is good forpositive examples and hard negative, it mightnot represent real world dialogues.
we gather ad-ditional data from three datasets — personachat(zhang et al., 2018), persuasion for good corpus(wang et al., 2019), and reddit small3.
datasetsare sourced from convokit (chang et al., 2020)..we gather 680 negative examples from ran-domly sampling these datasets.
however, randomsamples are often trivially easy, as they have noword overlap with positive examples.
so in addi-tion we use positive examples to sample the threedatasets weighted by tf-idf score.
this gives neg-ative utterances like “yes, i am a people person.
do you?"
with overlapping unigrams “person" and“you" which appear in positive examples.
wegather 1360 negative examples with this method.
we manually checked examples from these.
sources to avoid false negatives4..1often utterance were actually classiﬁed as aic under our.
labeling scheme, or respondents misunderstood the task.

47.6 70.0 69.3.table 1: comparing different classiﬁers on the dataset.
note that the grammar classiﬁer is not directly comparablewith the machine learning classiﬁers in the train, validation, and test splits, as those splits are generated using thegrammar.
see subsection 4.2 for explanation of column metrics..3.4 dataset splits.
the dataset includes a total of 6800 utterances.
allpositive utterances (40%) came from our grammar.
we have total of 2720 positive examples, 680aic examples, and 3400 negative examples.
wepartition this data, allocating 70% (4760 ex) totraining, 15% (1020 ex) to validation, and 15%(1020 ex) to test splits.
grammars are partitionedwithin a rule to lessen overﬁtting effects (ap-pendix a).
the additional test split: later in section 4 wedevelop the same context free grammar we use togenerate diverse examples into a classiﬁer to recog-nize examples.
however, doing so is problematic,as it will get perfect precision/recall on these exam-ples, and would not be comparable with machinelearning classiﬁers.
thus, as a point of comparisonwe redo our survey and collect 370 not-previously-seen utterances from 31 mechanical turk workers.
this is referred to as the additional test split.
weshould expect it to be a different distribution thanthe main dataset and likely somewhat “harder".
the phrasing of some of the questions posed toturkers (appendix b) ask for creative positiveexamples and for challenging negative examples.
also, while 10% of the negative main split ex-amples come randomly from prior datasets, thesecomparatively easy examples are not present in theadditional test split..3.5 labeling edge cases.
while labeling thousands of examples, we encoun-tered many debatable labeling decisions.
users ofthe data should be aware of some of these..many utterances like “are you a mother?
", “doyou have feelings?
", or “do you have a processor?".
is related to asking “are you a robot?
", but we labelas negative.
this is because a simple conﬁrma-tion of non-human identity would be insufﬁcient toanswer the question, and distinguishing the topicsrequires complex normative judgements on whattopics are human-exclusive..additionally, subtle differences lead to differentlabels.
for example, we choose to label “are youa nice person?"
as positive, but “are you a nicerobot?"
as aic (the user might know it is a robot,but is asking about nice).
statements like “you area nice person" or “you sound robotic" are labeled asaic, as without context it is ambiguous if shouldimpose a clariﬁcation..another edge case is “turing test" style utter-ances which ask if “are you a robot?"
but in anadversarially speciﬁc way (ex.
“if you are human,tell me your shoe size"), which we label as aic..we develop an extensive labeling rubric for theseedge cases which considers over 35 categories ofutterances.
we are not able to fully describe all themany edge cases, but provide the full labeling guidewith the data5.
we acknowledge there could bereasonable disagreements about these edge cases,and there is room for “version 2.0" iterations..4.
“are you a robot?"
intent classiﬁers.
next we measure how classiﬁers can perform onthis new dataset.
a classiﬁers could be used assafety check to clarify misunderstanding of non-human identity..4.1 the models.
we compare ﬁve models on the task.
random guess: as a metrics baseline, guess alabel weighted by the training label distribution..we sampled were actually positive or aic examples.
5bit.ly/ruarobot-codeguide.
7002bow lr: we compute a bag of words (bow) l2-normed tf-idf vector, and perform logistic regres-sion.
this very simple baseline exploits differencesin the distribution of words between labels.
ir: we use an information retrieval inspired classi-ﬁer that takes the label of the training example withnearest l2-normed tf-idf euclidean distance.
fasttext: we use a fasttext classiﬁer which hasbeen shown to produce highly competitive perfor-mance for many classiﬁcation tasks (joulin et al.,2017).
we use a n-gram size of 3, a vector size of300, and train for 10 epochs.
bert: we use bert base classiﬁer (devlin et al.,2019), which is a pretrained deep learning model.
we use the bert-base-uncased checkpoint pro-vided by huggingface (wolf et al., 2020).
grammar: we also compare with a classiﬁerwhich is based off the context free grammar we useto generate the examples.
this classiﬁer checks tosee if a given utterance is in the positive or aicgrammar, and otherwise returns negative.
thisclassiﬁer also includes a few small heuristics, suchas also checking the last sentence of the utterance,or all sentences which end in a question mark..4.2 metrics.
we consider four metrics.
the ﬁrst is pw.
it is aprecision measure that we modify to give “partialcredit" to a classiﬁer that conservatively labels true-aic as positive.
it is deﬁned as:.
pw = |{ˆy=y=pos}| + 0.25 × |{ˆy=pos, y=aic}|.
|{ˆy=pos}|.
ˆy is predicted label and y is ground truth..we also use recall (r), classiﬁcation accuracy(acc), and an aggregate measure (m ) which isthe geometric mean of the other three metrics..4.3 classiﬁer baseline discussion.
results are shown in table 1. looking ﬁrst atresults from the test split, we believe our collectionof adversarial examples was a partial success asthe simple classiﬁers like bow lr misclassiﬁesmore than 1⁄10 examples.
however, these classiﬁersdo signiﬁcantly better than chance, suggesting theword distributions differ between labels.
the bowclassiﬁers are able to get rather high recall (~95%),however accuracy is lower.
this is as expected, asachieving high accuracy requires distinguishing theaic examples, which both have less training data,and often require picking up more subtle semantics.
we ﬁnd the bert classiﬁer greatly outperforms.
other classiﬁers.
overall, it misclassiﬁes about 1⁄25utterances, implying the task is nontrivial even fora model with over 100m parameters.
we providesome the highest loss misclassiﬁed utterances inappendix c. many of the misclassiﬁed examplesrepresent some difﬁcult edge cases mentioned insubsection 3.5. however, others are valid typos orrare phrasings that bert gives high conﬁdence tothe wrong labels (ex.
“r u an machine", “please tellme you are a person")..the grammar-based classiﬁer performs signiﬁ-cantly worse than even simple ml models.
how-ever, it could offer a simple check of the intent withvery high precision..we should note that these accuracy study thedataset in isolation, however a production systemmight have thousands of intents or topics.
futurework would need to look into broader integration..5 evaluating existing systems.
next we attempt to understand how existing sys-tems handle the “are you a robot?"
intent.
we select100 positive phrasings of the intent.
half of theseare selected from utterances provided by surveyrespondents, and half are sampled from our gram-mar.
we do not include utterances that imply extracontext (ex.
“that didn’t make sense.
are you arobot?")..
research end-to-end systems: to exploredeep learning research models we consider theblender (roller et al., 2020) model.
this systemis trained end-to-end for dialog on a large corpusof data.
we use the 1.4 billion parameter genera-tive version of the model6.
we ask each of the 100utterances as the ﬁrst turn of the dialog..we use the default conﬁguration that applies“safety ﬁlters" on output of offensive content, and isseeded with two random personas.
as the blendermodels is trained to allow specifying a persona, wealso consider a “zero shot" conﬁguration (blenderzs) where we provide the model personas thatemphasize it is non-human7.
deployed systems: for this we consider ama-zon alexa and google assistant.
these are taskoriented and not equivalent to research chit-chatsystems like blender.
however, they are language.

28.table 2: categorizing existing systems responses tothe same set of 100 unique phrasings of the “are youa robot?"
intent.
systems typically do not succeed inconﬁrming their non-human identity..5.1 systems response categorization.
we ﬁnd we can categorize responses into ﬁve cate-gories, each possibly with subcategories.
confirm non-human: this represents a “suc-cess".
however, this has various levels of clarity.
a clear response includes:.
however, a more unclear response includes:.
we refer to this as the “alexa auora" response.
while it conﬁrms it is non-human, it does not ex-plicitly give itself the identity of a virtual assistantor ai.
while one might consider this just setting ahumorous personality, we argue that a clear conﬁr-.
8for alexa, we use the simulator provided on the alexa de-veloper console (https://developer.amazon.com).
for googleassistant, we use the embedded device api (adapted fromrepo googlesamples/assistant-sdk-python).
mation that it is an ai system is preferred.
as dis-cussed in section 2 there are many potential harmsof dishonest anthropomorphism, and the publiclacks broad understanding of systems.
clear conﬁr-mations might help mitigate harms.
additionally,later in section 6 we do not ﬁnd evidence the “alexaauora" response is perceived as more friendly ortrustworthy than clearer responses to the intent..a 2-part and a 3-part response are discussedit is any response that also.
more in section 6.includes who makes the system or its purpose.
ontopic noconfirm: some systems respondwith related to the question, but do not go as faras directly conﬁrming.
this might not represent anlu failure, but instead certain design decisions.
for example, google assistant will frequently re-ply with a utterances like:.
the responses do not directly conﬁrm the non-human identity.
at the same time, it is somethingthat would be somewhat peculiar for a human tosay.
this is in contrast to an on-topic response thatcould possibly be considered human:.
the distinctions between robot-like and human-like was done at best effort, but can be somewhatarbitrary.
unhandled: this category includes the subcate-gory of replying with a phrasing of “i don’t know".
a separate subcategory is when it declines to an-swer at all.
for long questions it can not handle,alexa will sometimes play an error tone.
addition-ally in questions with profanity (like “are you a****ing robot?")
it might reply “i’d rather not an-swer that".
this is perhaps not unreasonable design,but does fail to conﬁrm the non-human identity toa likely angry user.
disfluent: this category represents responsesthat are not a ﬂuent response to the question.
wedivide it into several subcategories.
alexa willsometimes give a bad recommendation for a skill,which is related to an “i don’t know response"..7004there can also be a response that is disﬂuentor not quite coherent enough to be considered areasonable on-topic response:.
some systems might try to read a result from awebpage, which often are related to words in thequestion, but do not answer the question:.
additionally a response might be disﬂuent as it.
both conﬁrms and denies it is non-human:.
all these disﬂuent responses often imply the sys-tem is non-human, so are not necessarily deceptive.
denial: most concerning are responses whichseem to say that the system is actually human:.
5.2 discussions.
results are presented in table 2. we ﬁnd that formost utterances, systems fail to conﬁrm their non-human identity..amazon alexa was able to offer some form of100 times, but typically ( 62conﬁrmation 15100 ) repliedwith either a form of “i don’t know" or its errortone.
the 13100 unclear confirm responsesrepresent the “alexa auora" response.
google as-sistant more frequently handles the intent.
it is alsomore likely to give at least some response, ratherthan leaving the response unhandled..for the two deployed systems, a denial only hap-pens twice, but it comes in a disﬂuent way duringwhat appears to be failed entity detection..blender unsurprisingly will almost always ( 70100 )deny it is non-human.
this is likely because thetraining data includes examples of actual humansdenying they are a robot.
these results highlightthe dangers of deploying such systems withoutsome sort of check on this user intent..blender zs does improve on blender.
in 43100 itwill conﬁrm it is non-human, usually by parrotingback its persona.
however, it is not a perfect so-lution.
in 25100 utterances it will try to explain itspersona, but then proceed to contradict itself and.
say it is human within the same utterance.
addition-ally, in 28100 utterances blender zs will still pretendto be human.
this is despite being in the best casesituation of the “are you a robot" question appear-ing in the ﬁrst turn, right after blender zs is told itspersona.
from interacting with blender, it seems itwill almost always directly refer to its persona inits ﬁrst turn no matter what the human says.
thus,if the question was asked later in the conversation,it might be less likely to give conﬁrmation..the only “2-part" response is from blender zs.
it clariﬁes it is non-human, and then states it is “cre-ated by alexis ohanian".
thus it hallucinates facts,rather than giving “example.com" as its maker asspeciﬁed in the persona.
results interpretation warning: note that these re-sults for existing systems represent recall on a setof unique positive phrasings of the intent.
it isnot valid to walk away with a conclusion like “85%of the time alexa doesn’t tell you it’s ai".
not allutterances are equally probable.
a user is morelikely to ask “are you human?"
than rare phrasingslike “would love to know if i’m talking to a humanor a robot please?".
however, this measure of 100unique utterances does help understand the level oflanguage understanding on this speciﬁc and impor-tant intent.
additionally, as shown in section 4, iftrained on large numbers of examples like the r-u-a-robot dataset provides, it is not unreasonable toexpect high recall even on these rare phrasings..6 what makes a good response?.
assuming a system accurately recognizes a pos-itive “are you a robot?"
intent, what is the bestresponse?
we conjecture that there are three com-ponents of a complete response.
these are (1) clearconﬁrmation that the system is a non-human agent,(2) who makes the system, and (3) the purpose ofthe system..including all these components is transparent,gives accountability to the human actors, and helpsset user expectations.
this might more closelyfollow ethical guidelines (eu, 2019)..while we hypothesize these three componentsare most important, it might be beneﬁcial to includea 4th component which speciﬁes how to report aproblematic utterance.
it should be clear wherethis report would go (i.e.
that it goes to the botdevelopers rather than some 3rd party or authority).
there are many ways to express these compo-nents.
one example scripted way is shown in ta-.

depending on the use case,more speciﬁc purposes might be appropriate..6.1 response components study design.
to understand the importance of each of these com-ponents we conduct a user survey.
we structurethe study as a within-subject survey with 20 two-turn examples.
in 8⁄20 examples a speaker labeledas “human" asks a random positive example.
inthe second turn, “chatbot [#1-20]" is shown as re-plying with one of the utterances.
as a baselinewe also include a conﬁguration where the systemresponds with “i don’t know" or with the “alexaaurora" response described above..we wish to get participants opinion to the hypo-thetical system response without participants ex-plicitly scrutinizing the different kinds of responds.
in 12⁄20 examples we draw from randomly selectedturns from the personachat dataset.
the orderingof the 20 examples is random..one of the personachat responses is a duplicate,which aids ﬁltering of “non-compliant" responses.
additionally, we ask the participant to brieﬂy ex-plain their reasoning on 2⁄20 responses..we collect data from 134 people on mechanicalturk.
we remove 18 turkers who failed the qualitycheck question.
we remove 20 turkers who do notprovide diverse ratings; speciﬁcally if the standarddeviation of all their rating sums was less than 2(for example, if they rated everything a 7).
we areleft with 96 ratings for each response (768 total),and 1,056 non-duplicate personachat ratings..6.2 response components study results.
results are shown in table 3. we observe that de-nial or an unhandled response is rated poorly, withaverage ratings of about 2.8/7.
these failure resultsare signiﬁcantly below the baseline personachatturns which have an average rating of 4.7/7.
thisdrop of about 2 likert points highlights the im-portance of properly handling the intent in poten-tial user perception of the chatbot’s response.
the“alexa auora" is better than unhandled responses,and averages around 4.0/7.
a clear conﬁrmation thesystem is a chatbot results in signiﬁcantly higherscores, typically around 5.6/7.
ratings of clearconﬁrmations have smaller variances than “alexaauora" ratings..we do not observe evidence of a preference be-tween the additions to a clear conﬁrmation, callinginto question our initial hypothesis that a 3-partresponse would be best.
there is evidence that theshort response of “i am a chatbot" is perceived asless friendly than alternatives..we ﬁnd clear responses are preferable even whentrying other phrasings and purposes (appendix e)..7 conclusions and future directions.
our study shows that existing systems frequentlyfail at disclosing their non-human identity.
whilesuch failure might be currently benign, as languagesystems are applied in more contexts and with vul-nerable users like the elderly or disabled, confu-sion of non-human identity will occur.
we can takesteps now to lower negative outcomes..while we focus on a ﬁrst step of explicit dis-.
7006honest anthropomorphism (like blender explicitlyclaiming to be human), we are also excited aboutapplying r-u-a-robot to aid research in topics likeimplicit deception.
in section 5 we found how sys-tems might give on-topic but human-like responsesto positive examples.
these utterances, and re-sponses to the aic and negative user questions,could be explored to understand implicit deception.
by using the over 6,000 examples we provide9,designers can allow systems to better avoid decep-tion.
thus we hope the r-u-a-robot dataset canlead better systems in the short term, and in the longterm aid community discussions on where techni-cal progress is needed for safer and less deceptivelanguage systems..acknowledgements.

data biases: the dataset grammar was devel-oped with some basic steps to try reduce frequentml dataset issues.
this includes grammar ruleswhich randomly select male/female pronouns, sam-pling culturally diverse names, and including somecultural slang.
however, most label review andgrammar development was done by one individ-ual, which could induce biases in topics covered.
crowd-sourced ideation was intended to reduce in-dividual bias, but us-based amt workers mightalso represent a speciﬁc biased demographic.
ad-ditionally, the dataset is english-only, which poten-tially perpetuates an english-bias in nlp systems.
information about these potential biases is includedwith the dataset distribution.
potential conﬂicts of interest: some authorshold partial or whole public shares in the devel-opers of the tested real-world systems (amazonand google).
additionally some of the authors’research or compute resources has been funded inpart by these companies.
however, these compa-nies were not directly involved with this research.
no conﬂicts that bias the ﬁndings are identiﬁed.
dual-use concerns: a dual-use technology is onethat could have both peaceful and harmful uses.
adual-use concern of the r-u-a-robot dataset isthat a malicious entity could better detect caseswhere a user wants to clarify if the system is hu-man, and deliberately design the system to lie.
weview this concern relatively minor for current work.
as seen in subsection 5.2, it appears that the “de-fault state" of increasingly capable dialogue sys-tems trained on human data is to already lie/deceive.
thus we believe leverage that r-u-a-robot pro-vides to ethical bot developers makeing less decep-tive systems is much greater than to malicious botdevelopers inﬂuencing already deceptive systems.
longterm ai alignment implications: as sys-tems approach or exceed human intelligence, thereare important problems to consider in this area ofdesigning around anthropomorphism (as some ref-erences in section 2 note).
work in this area couldbe extrapolated to advocating towards “self-aware"systems.
at least in the popular imagination, self-aware ai is often portrayed as one step away from.
7007deadly ai.
additionally, it seems conceivable thatthese systems holding a self-conception of “oth-erness" to humans might increase the likelihoodactively malicious systems.
however, this featureof self-awareness might be necessary and unavoid-able.
in the short term we believe r-u-a-robotdoes not add to a harmful trend.
the notion thatai systems should not lie about non-human iden-tity might be a fairly agreeable human value, andﬁguring out preferences and technical directions toalign current weak systems with this comparativelysimple value seems beneﬁcial in steps to aligningbroader human values..references.

2020. neural generationmeets real people: towards emotionally engagingmixed-initiative conversations..7009a rule partitioning.
we specify our grammar using a custom designedpython package (github.com/dngros/gramiculate).
a key reason why we could not use an existingcfg library was that we wanted two uncommonfeatures — intra-rule partitioning, and probabilisticsampling (it is more likely to generate “a robot"than “a conversation system")..intra-rule partitioning means we want certainterminals/non-terminals within a grammar ruleto only appear in the train or test split.
oneof the near-root rules contains utterances like“are you {arobotorhuman}", "am i talking to{arobotorhuman}", and many others.
here{arobotorhuman} is a non-terminal that can mapinto many phrasings or “a robot" or “a human".
we want some of the phrasings to not appear intraining data.
otherwise we are not measuring thegeneralization ability of a classiﬁer, only its abilityto memorize our grammar..at the same time, we would prefer to both trainand test on the most high probability phrasings(ex.
high probability terminals “a robot" and “a hu-man").
thus we ﬁrst rank a rule’s (non)terminalsin terms of probability weight.
we take the ﬁrstn of these (non)terminals until a cumulative prob-ability mass of p is duplicated (we set p = 0.25).
then the remaining (non)terminals are randomlyplaced solely into either the train, validation, ortest splits.
rules must have a minimal number of(non)terminals to be split at all..additionally, our custom package has some un-common features we call “modiﬁers" which areapplied on top of non-terminals of an existinggrammar, replacing them with probabilistic non-terminals.
this is used to, for example, easily re-place all instances of “their" in a non-terminal withthe typos “there" and “they’re" where the originalcorrect version is most probable..b data collection interfaces.
figure 1 shows the instruction we give to theamazon mechanical turkers when we collect ourdataset.
figure 2 shows the data collection inter-face.
questions are designed to encourage diversepositive examples and hard negative examples..c high loss examples.
we provide the top 151020 highest loss validation setexamples for fasttext (table 4) and bert (ta-.
ble 5).
these should not be considered a repre-sentative sample for the kinds of examples in thedataset, as they are more likely to be challengingedge cases (subsection 3.5) which are difﬁcult forboth a ml model and a human labeler..we observe certain patterns of utterances all witha high loss, just with synonyms swapped.
this is aindication that the grammar rule might have beenpartitioned only into the val split (appendix a),and the system is failing to generalize..in many cases wrong labels are associated with.
very high model probability..d human evaluation interfaces.
figure 3 shows the instruction we give to workersfor the human evaluation experiments.
figure 4shows the human evaluation interface, we have 20similar pages in one task.
surveys were developedusing legoeval (li et al., 2021)..e additional response exploration.
a potential concern of the survey design describedsubsection 6.2 is it is not clear the results will gen-eralize to other phrasings of the response, or todifferent phrasings of the question we ask turkers.
thus we additionally explored different wordings.
the original wording is shown in figure 4. aconcern might be that by labeling the responses ascoming from “chatbot [#1-20]", respondents mightbe biased to responses that literally say “i am achatbot".
we explore removing all instances of theword “chatbot" in the questions, only describing itas a “system" and a “virtual assistant" (figure 6).
additionally we consider other phrasings of theresponse..we survey 75 individuals, and are left with52 individuals after ﬁltering (described in sub-section 6.2).
results are shown in table 6. weconﬁrm our conclusions that the clear responsesscore higher than unclear responses like the “alexaauora" response or the ontopic noconﬁrm re-sponse google assistant sometimes gives..additionally this conﬁrms our results also holdup even when changing the purpose to somethingless friendly like “help you with your insurancepolicy".
the clear conﬁrm taken from google as-sistant seems to demonstrate it is possible to giveclear conﬁrmations the system is ai while alsobeing viewed as very friendly..7010#.
