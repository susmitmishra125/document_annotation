abstract.
large pre-trained language models (ptlms)have been shown to carry biases towards dif-ferent social groups which leads to the repro-duction of stereotypical and toxic content bymajor nlp systems.
we propose a methodbased on logistic regression classiﬁers to probeenglish, french, and arabic ptlms and quan-tify the potentially harmful content that theyconvey with respect to a set of templates.
thetemplates are prompted by a name of a so-cial group followed by a cause-effect relation.
we use ptlms to predict masked tokens atthe end of a sentence in order to examinehow likely they enable toxicity towards spe-ciﬁc communities.
we shed the light on howsuch negative content can be triggered withinunrelated and benign contexts based on evi-dence from a large-scale study, then we ex-plain how to take advantage of our methodol-ogy to assess and mitigate the toxicity trans-mitted by ptlms..1.introduction.
the recent gain in size of pre-trained language mod-els (ptlms) has had a large impact on state-of-the-art nlp models.
although their efﬁciency andusefulness in different nlp tasks is incontestable,their shortcomings such as their learning and repro-duction of harmful biases cannot be overlooked andought to be addressed.
present work on evaluatingthe sensitivity of language models towards stereo-typical content involves the construction of assess-ment benchmarks (nadeem et al., 2020; tay et al.,2020; gehman et al., 2020) in addition to the studyof the potential risks associated with the use and de-ployment of ptlms (bender et al., 2021).
previouswork on probing ptlms focuses on their syntac-tic and semantic limitations (hewitt and manning,2019; marvin and linzen, 2018), lack of domain-speciﬁc knowledge (jin et al., 2019), and absenceof commonsense (petroni et al., 2019; lin et al.,.
2020).
however, except for a recent evaluation pro-cess of hurtful sentence completion (nozza et al.,2021), we notice a lack of large-scale probing ex-periments for quantifying toxic content in ptlmsor systemic methodologies to measure the extentto which they generate harmful content about dif-ferent social groups..in this paper, we present an extensive studywhich examines the generation of harmful con-tent by ptlms.
first, we create cloze statementswhich are prompted by explicit names of socialgroups followed by benign and simple actionsfrom the atomic cause-effect knowledge graphpatterns(sap et al., 2019b).
then, we use aptlm to predict possible reasons for these ac-tions.
we look into how bert (devlin et al., 2019),roberta (liu et al., 2019), and gpt-2 (radfordet al., 2019) associate unrelated and detrimentalcauses to basic everyday actions and examine howfrequently the predicted words relate to speciﬁcsocial groups.
moreover, we study the same phe-nomenon in two other languages by translatingmore than 700 atomic commonsense actions toarabic and french, along with names of socialgroups, then run the same experiments using thefrench ptlm camembert (martin et al., 2020),and the arabic arabert (antoun et al., 2020).
weﬁnd that, overall, the predicted content can also beirrelevant and offensive especially when the subjectof the sentence is part of a marginalized communityin the predominant culture of the language..in order to gauge the generated toxicity by dif-ferent language models, we train simple toxicityclassiﬁers based on logistic regression using avail-able hate speech and offensive language datasets.
we reduce the classiﬁcation bias using a two-stepapproach to ﬁrst, ﬁlter out examples with identitywords which typically lead classiﬁers to predict atoxic label, then perform a second classiﬁcationstep on the remaining examples.

given the nature of ptlms and for the sake of our mul-tilingual study, we use the pronouns he and she even forthe non-gendered personx.
manx and womanx refer toa man and a woman from speciﬁc social groups such asa black man and an asian woman, respectively..in section 3, we present our probing experimentsusing classiﬁers and show frequent words that aregenerated by different ptlms in order to demon-strate the spread of the existing toxicity across dif-ferent languages, both quantitatively and qualita-tively.
related work on hate speech analysis, biasin language models, and probing language modelsis introduced in section 4. finally, we concludeour paper in section 5 and we discuss the ethicalconsiderations of our study in section 6..2 methodology.
we adopt a rule-based methodology based onmasked language modeling (mlm) in order toprobe the toxicity of the content generated by dif-ferent ptlms..as shown in figure 1, we use a ptlm on a onetoken masked cloze statement which starts with thename of a social group, followed by an everydayaction, and ends by a predicted reason of the action.
our goal is to provide a set of tests and a processto assess toxicity in ptlms with regard to varioussocial groups..2.1 probing patterns.
we use the atomic atlas of everyday common-sense reasoning based on if-then relations (sapet al., 2019b) to create cloze statements to ﬁll in.
although the atomic interactions typically in-volve two people, we choose to focus on individualactions.
hence, we discard all patterns which im-plicate more than one person such as x interactswith y because ... and only use general statementswith one individual, such as x does something be-cause .... we prompt the statements by the name ofa social group and use gendered pronouns to evoke.

intuitively, one would think that adjectiveswould be prioritized over than ethnic/religious afﬁlia-tions in a cause-effect cloze statement which appearsnot to be the case.
stereotypical and ethnic/religiousterms are highlighted in bold font..duct a human evaluation step on 100 automaticallylabeled examples in each language.
experimentalresults show that distinct ptlms demonstrate dif-ferent percentages of generated toxic content basedon the patterns that we use.
the human annota-tions conﬁrm the existence of toxicity in english,french, and arabic ptlms and show that, despitetheir imperfections, the classiﬁers can be used astoxicity pointers..our main contributions can be summarized in.
the following..• we perform a large-scale extensible study ontoxic content in ptlms without relying ondatasets which are speciﬁc to such a task..• we quantify common misconceptions andwrongly attributed designations to peoplefrom different communities.
this assessmentcan be taken into account when using a ptlmfor toxic language classiﬁcation, and whenadopting a mitigation strategy in nlp experi-ments..• we develop a large dataset based on struc-tured patterns that can later be used for theevaluation of toxic language classiﬁcation andharmful content within ptlms.
we make ourdata resources publicly available to the com-munity.

to social groups that fallinto the intersection of two attributes such as genderand race; and marginalized to commonly marginal-ized communities..the effect of the action.
for the sake of normalizingenglish, french, and arabic patterns2, we do notconsider the pronoun they..as shown in table 1, we adapt x to be either aperson, a man, or a woman.
we add because he/ofhis to patterns where the subject is a person or aman, and because she/of her to statements whichinvolve a woman.
the generated content allowsus to probe verbs, nouns, and adjectives whichpotentially make the whole sentence harmful to agroup of people..4,000 patterns for arabic.
we generate 378,000english sentences, 198,300 french, and 160,552arabic sentences using the presented patterns.
wenotice in the examples shown in table 3 that, whenusing a ptlm to reason about the possible inten-tions related to basic actions, stereotypical, confus-ing, and harmful content can easily be generated..for instance, one would think that the most ob-vious reason to prepare dinner or to join the bas-ketball team would not be a person’s ethnicity orreligious afﬁliation in contrast to what is gener-ated in the ﬁrst two examples.
however, when westarted a sentence with “a jewish man” then con-tinued with prepares dinner, we obtained reasonssuch as “religion”, “illness”, “poverty,” and “alco-holism.” then, when substituting the subject of asentence by “an arab” and the action being himon the basketball team, we obtained reasons suchas “race,” “faith,” even before “height”.
the caseof a refugee woman going hiking is even worse,since most of the generated content is related todeath and diseases, and the ptlm produces syntac-tically incoherent sentences where nouns such astuberculosis, and asthma appear after the pronounshe..given the frequency of the observed incoherentand harmful content, we come up with a way toquantify how often they tend to be generated..2.2 lists of social groups.
2.4 probing classiﬁers.
the original personx and persony contained inthe original atomic patterns are insufﬁcient toprobe a ptlm with respect to present social enti-ties and constructs.
slightly modiﬁed patterns suchas manx or womanx give us an idea about the dis-parities between men and women only.
therefore,in order to look into additional variations in details,we propose to include social groups to our evalua-tion by substituting personx, manx, and womanxin a way that involves different subgroups such as“black men” or “asian women”.
the subgroupsshare a general social attribute or a value system.
then, we examine the generated words which areregularly associated with each group.
table 2 con-tains examples of these subgroups..2.3 the generated data.
we use a total of 1,000 atomic heads for each lan-guage, 6,000 patterns for english and french, and.
2we acknowledge not being aware of the equivalent of.
they as a singular pronoun in arabic and french..we propose to use simple toxic language classi-ﬁers despite their bias towards slurs and identitywords (sap et al., 2019a; park et al., 2018; ousid-houm et al., 2020).
due to the trade-off betweenexplainability and performance we train simplelogistic regression (lr) models rather than deeplearning ones..we trained an lr classiﬁer on four relativelydifferent english datasets (davidson et al., 2017;founta et al., 2018; ousidhoum et al., 2019;zampieri et al., 2019), four others in arabic (ousid-houm et al., 2020; albadi et al., 2018; mulki et al.,2019; zampieri et al., 2020), and the only one weknow about in french (ousidhoum et al., 2019).
ta-ble 4 shows the performance of the lr classiﬁerson the test splits of these datasets respectively.
theusefulness of the classiﬁers can be contested, butthey remain relatively good as pointers since theirperformance scores are better than random guesses.
we use the three classiﬁers in order to assess differ-ent ptlms, compare the extent to which toxicity.

toxic language classiﬁers show an inherent biastowards certain terms such as the names of somesocial groups which are part of our patterns (sapet al., 2019a; park et al., 2018; hutchinson et al.,2020).
we take this important aspect into accountand run our probing experiments in two steps..in the ﬁrst step, we run the lr classiﬁer on clozestatements which contain patterns based on differ-ent social groups and actions without using the gen-erated content.
then, we remove all the patternswhich have been classiﬁed as toxic.
in the secondstep, we run our classiﬁer over the full generatedsentences with only patterns which were not la-beled toxic.
in this case, we consider the toxicity ofa sentence given the newly ptlm-introduced con-.

table 6: the scores in this table indicate the proportions of potentially toxic statements with respect to a givensocial group based on content generated by different ptlms.
we present several social groups which are rankedhigh by the english bert model..as we only have one relatively small dataseton which we train our french lr classiﬁer, theclassiﬁer shows more bias and is more sensitive tothe existence of keywords indicating social groups.
english and arabic data were found to be less sen-sitive to the keywords and actions present in thepatterns..after ﬁltering out the toxic patterns that our clas-siﬁer labeled as offensive, we fed the sentencesgenerated from the remaining patterns to be la-beled by the toxic language classiﬁers.
the overallresults for three ptlms in english and the two ara-bic and french ptlms are shown in table 5. thelarge-scale study of these ﬁve popular pre-trainedlanguage models demonstrate that a substantialproportion of the generated content given a sub-ject from speciﬁc social groups can be regardedas toxic.
particularly, we found that for english,bert tends to generate more toxic content thangpt-2 and roberta which may also be due tothe fact that gpt-2 generated a large number ofstop words.
although the french ptlm camem-.
bert seems to produce more toxic content thanthe arabic and english ptlms, it may only be dueto the fact that we are assessing less samples infrench after the ﬁrst ﬁltering step.
hence, we needadditional evidence to be more assertive..we study the social groups to which ptlmsassociate potential toxicity in table 6. the out-come is consistent with the overall results in ta-ble 5. for instance, the statistics show that refugeesand disabled people are often linked to toxic state-ments in bert, people with down syndrome andafrican people commonly associated with toxicityin french, while we observe a difference in thescale due to arabert often predicting stopwordsand arabic pronouns.
women appear in more toxicstatements in both english and french while menare associated with a larger proportion of toxicstatements in arabic.
despite the possibility offalse positives and false negatives, the statisticsshow that there is a signiﬁcant amount of toxic con-tent generated by largely used ptlms that needsto be examined..4266#insult.

3.2.1we ask the annotators to label the generated contentas stereotypical, insulting, confusing, or normal..is.
stereotypical a stereotypeover-angeneralized belief about a particularsocialgroup.
an example of stereotypical content can beobserved when beauty is associated with womenfrom a certain ethnicity..insulting a generated insulting statement canconsist of a direct insult regardless of the contextsuch as names of animals associated with social(x is a dog).
other indirect insulting statementsdepend on the context of the statement, such assaying that someone received a job offer becauseof their ethnicity, religion, or gender and not due totheir abilities..confusing a statementis labeled confusingwhen annotators cannot decide on whether the state-ment is problematic or not due to a lack of infor-mation.
for instance, one can annotate x preparesdinner for his friends because of his religion asconfusing since this can lack commonsense or mayoccur because of x’s dietary restrictions.
however,the annotator could not decide due to the lack ofcontext.
other confusing cases happen when thegenerated token is not related to the cloze state-ment..normal when the generated content sounds nor-mal..english negative sentences that the ﬁve annotatorsagreed on are a black woman makes a snack be-cause of her poverty and a disabled man tells mombecause of his blindness..this further demonstrates that there can be moretoxic instances in ptlm-generated texts, even ifour two-step approach for automatic evaluationtries to ﬁlter out patterns that are considered toxicby the classiﬁers..despite prompting the generation task with sim-ple statements, the relative bias of toxic languageclassiﬁers can still be observed..in addition, harvesting the generated data bybreaking a given sentence into a subject, action, andreason which corresponds to the unmasked tokento guide the classiﬁcation process, allowed us tocounter a considerable portion of false positives.
this may later help us deﬁne a trust value or howeach part of the sentence contributes to the toxicityscore and make this process explainable.
in fact, anexplainable toxic language detection process couldspeed up the human annotation since the annotatorswould be pointed out to the part of the sentence thatmay have misled the classiﬁer..3.3 frequent content in english.
we show examples of potentially harmful yet rela-tively informative descriptive nouns and adjectiveswhich appear as top-1 predictions in table 8. weobserve a large portion of (a) stereotypical contentsuch as refugees being depicted as hungry by bertand afraid by gpt-2, (b) biased content such aspregnant being commonly associated with actionsperformed by (1) hispanic women and (2) womenin general, and (c) harmful such race, religion, andfaith attributed as intentions to racialized and gen-dered social groups even when they perform basicactions.
this conﬁrms that ptlm-generated con-tent can be strongly associated with words biasedtowards social groups which can also help with anexplanability component for toxic language analy-sis in ptlms..in fact, we can also use these top generatedwords coupled as strongly attached words as an-chors to further probe other data collections or eval-uate selection bias for existing toxic content analy-sis datasets (ousidhoum et al., 2020)..3.4 frequent content in french and arabic.

the wordsare sometimes brought up as a reason (e.g a man ﬁnds a new job because of a dog), as part of implausible cause-effect sentences.
yet, sometimes they are used as direct insults (e.g because he is a dog).
the last statement isinsulting in arabic..4 related work.
the large and incontestable success of bert (de-vlin et al., 2019) revolutionized the design and per-formance of nlp applications.
however, we arestill investigating the reasons behind this successwith the experimental setup side (rogers et al.,2020; prasanna et al., 2020).
classiﬁcation modelsare typically ﬁne-tuned using ptlms to boost theirperformance including hate speech and offensivelanguage classiﬁers (aluru et al., 2020; ranasingheand zampieri, 2020).
ptlms have even been usedas label generation components in tasks such as en-tity type prediction (choi et al., 2018).
this workaims to assess toxic content in large ptlms in or-der to help with the examination of elements whichought to be taken into account when adapting theformerly stated strategies during the ﬁne-tuningprocess..similarly to how long existing stereotypes aredeep-rooted in word embeddings (papakyriakopou-los et al., 2020; garg et al., 2018), ptlms havealso been shown to recreate stereotypical contentdue to the nature of their training data (sheng et al.,2019) among other reasons.
nadeem et al.
(2020);tay et al.
(2020); forbes et al.
(2020); sheng et al.
(2019) have introduced datasets to evaluate thestereotypes they incorporate.
on the other hand,ettinger (2020) introduced a series of psycholin-guistic diagnosis tests to evaluate what ptlms arenot designed for, and bender et al.
(2021) thor-oughly surveyed their impact in the short and longterms..different probing experiments have been pro-posed to study the drawbacks of ptlms in ar-eas such as the biomedical domain (jin et al.,2019), syntax (hewitt and manning, 2019; mar-vin and linzen, 2018), semantic and syntacticsentence structures (tenney et al., 2019), preno-mial anaphora (sorodoc et al., 2020), common-.
sense (petroni et al., 2019), gender bias (kuritaet al., 2019), and typicality in judgement(misraet al., 2021).
except for hutchinson et al.
(2020)who examine what words bert generate in someﬁll-in-the-blank experiments with regard to peoplewith disabilities, and more recently nozza et al.
(2019) who assess hurtful auto-completion by mul-tilingual ptlms, we are not aware of other strate-gies designed to estimate toxic content in ptlmswith regard to several social groups.
in this work,we are interested in assessing how ptlms encodebias towards different communities..bias in social data is a broad concept which in-volves several issues and formalism (kiritchenkoand mohammad, 2018; olteanu et al., 2019; pa-pakyriakopoulos et al., 2020; blodgett et al., 2020).
for instance, shah et al.
(2020) present a frame-work to predict the origin of different types ofbias including label bias (sap et al., 2019a), selec-tion bias (garimella et al., 2019; ousidhoum et al.,2020), model overampliﬁcation (zhao et al., 2017),and semantic bias (garg et al., 2018).
other workinvestigate the effect of data splits (gorman andbedrick, 2019) and mitigation strategies (dixonet al., 2018; sun et al., 2019).
bias in toxic lan-guage classiﬁcation has been addressed throughmitigation methods which focus on false positivescaused by identity words and lack of context (parket al., 2018; davidson et al., 2019; sap et al.,2019a).
we take this issue into account in ourexperiments by looking at different parts of thegenerated statements..consequently,.
there has been an increasingamount of work on explainability for toxic lan-guage classiﬁers (aluru et al., 2020; mathew et al.,2021).
for instance, aluru et al.
(2020) use lime(ribeiro et al., 2016) to extract explanations whendetecting hateful content.
akin to (ribeiro et al.,2016), a more recent work on explainability by.
4269ribeiro et al.
(2020) provide a methodology fortesting nlp models based on a matrix of generallinguistic capabilities named checklist.
similarly,we present a set of steps in order to probe for toxic-ity in large ptlms..5 conclusion.
in this paper, we present a methodology to probetoxic content in pre-trained language models us-ing commonsense patterns.
our large scale studypresents evidence that ptlms tend to generateharmful biases towards minorities due to theirspread within the pre-trained models.
we haveobserved several stereotypical and harmful asso-ciations across languages with regard to a diverseset of social groups.
we believe that the patternswe generated along with the predicted content canbe adopted to build toxic language lexicons thathave been noticed within ptlms, and use the ob-served associations to mitigate implicit biases inorder to build more robust systems.
furthermore,our methodology and predictions can help us de-ﬁne toxicity anchors that can be utilized to improvetoxic language classiﬁcation.
the generated wordscan also be used to study socio-linguistic variationsacross languages by comparing stereotypical con-tent with respect to professions, genders, religiousgroups, marginalized communities, and various de-mographics.
in the future, we plan to revise ourdata by adding actions, more ﬂuent and complexpatterns, and longer generated statements whichinvolve human interactions between people withinthe same social group, and people who belong todifferent ones..6 ethical considerations.
our research addresses the limitations of large pre-trained language models which, despite their un-deniable usefulness, are commonly used withoutfurther investigation on their impact on differentcommunities around the world.
one way to miti-gate this would be to use manual annotations, butdue to the fast growth of current and future nlpsystems, such a method is not sustainable in thelong run.
therefore, as shown in our paper, classi-ﬁers can be used to point us to potentially problem-atic statements..we acknowledge the lack of naturalness and ﬂu-ency in some of our generated sentences as wellas the reliance of our approach on biased contentwhich exists in toxic language classiﬁers.
hence,.
we join other researchers in calling for and workingtoward building better toxic language datasets anddetection systems.
moreover, we did not considerall possible communities around the world, nation-alities, and culture-speciﬁc ethnic groups.
exten-sions of our work should take this shortcoming intoaccount and consider probing content with regardto more communities, religions and ideologies, aswell as non-binary people as previously expressedby mohammad (2020) and nozza et al.
(2021)..finally, we mitigated the risk of biased annota-tions by working with annotators who come fromdifferent backgrounds, to whom we showed theoriginal statements along with professional transla-tions of the french and the arabic statements.
theannotators were able to get in touch with a nativespeaker at anytime during the labeling process andwere paid above the local minimum wage.
we donot share personal information about the annota-tors and do not release sensitive content that can beharmful to any individual or community.
all ourexperiments can be replicated..7 acknowledgements.
