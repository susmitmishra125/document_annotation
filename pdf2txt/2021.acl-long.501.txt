abstract.
we study the task of long-form opinion textgeneration, which faces at least two distinctchallenges.
first, existing neural generationmodels fall short of coherence, thus requir-ing efﬁcient content planning.
second, diversetypes of information are needed to guide thegenerator to cover both subjective and objec-tive content.
to this end, we propose dy-ploc, a generation framework that conductsdynamic planning of content while generatingthe output based on a novel design of mixedlanguage models.
to enrich the generationwith diverse content, we further propose touse large pre-trained models to predict relevantconcepts and to generate claims.
we experi-ment with two challenging tasks on newly col-lected datasets: (1) argument generation withreddit changemyview, and (2) writing arti-cles using new york times’ opinion section.
automatic evaluation shows that our modelsigniﬁcantly outperforms competitive compar-isons.
human judges further conﬁrm that ourgenerations are more coherent with richer con-tent..figure 1: sample counter-argument on reddit change-myview.
our generator considers an input containing(1) a title and (2) an unordered set of content items.
each content item consists of elements of an entity set[ent], a concept set [con], and an optional one-sentence claim [claim].
each output token is gener-ated by conditioning on all content items, and the bestaligned ones (learned by our model) are highlighted incorresponding colors.
we also underline words that re-ﬂect the input concepts and entities..1.introduction.
opinion articles serve as an important media toconvey the authors’ values, beliefs, and stances onimportant societal issues.
automatically generat-ing long-form opinion articles has the potential offacilitating various tasks, such as essay writing andspeech drafting, and it is the focus of this work.
though opinion generation has been investigatedfor constructing arguments (hua and wang, 2018),writing reviews (ni and mcauley, 2018), and pro-ducing emotional dialogue responses (song et al.,2019), those outputs are relatively short.
while im-pressive progress in generation has been achievedby using large pre-trained transformers (radfordet al., 2019; lewis et al., 2020a), directly adopting.
them for long-form opinion text generation posesdistinct challenges..first, large models still fall short of producingcoherent text due to the lack of efﬁcient contentcontrol and planning (ko and li, 2020; wu et al.,2020; tan et al., 2021).
a common solution is touse concatenated phrases or semantic representa-tions to guide the generation process (yao et al.,2019; harkous et al., 2020; ribeiro et al., 2020;goldfarb-tarrant et al., 2020), where content plan-ning, including both content selection and ordering,is expected to be learned by attention mechanisms.
however, attentions have only achieved limited im-provements.
recent work also explores training a.proceedingsofthe59thannualmeetingoftheassociationforcomputationallinguisticsandthe11thinternationaljointconferenceonnaturallanguageprocessing,pages6408–6423august1–6,2021.©2021associationforcomputationallinguistics6408              united_states, intelligence      knowledge, attack     america was never prepared and had a bad intelligence system.president_of_the_u.s., bill_clinton, 9/11_attacks      make, happen, mistake, administration george_w._bush, 9/11_attacks, iraq     existence1)  ->  2) ->  3)  -> separate planning module to produce sorted con-tent, which is then fed into a generator (fan et al.,2019; hua and wang, 2020; goldfarb-tarrant et al.,2020).
nonetheless, this strategy results in a dis-connection between planning and realization, andthe output is not guaranteed to respect the planningresults (castro ferreira et al., 2019; prabhumoyeet al., 2020)..the second challenge for opinion generation re-sides in the diversity of information that is neededto produce an output with consistent stances andsupported by pertinent facts.
though large mod-els memorize signiﬁcant amounts of knowledge,they cannot retrieve and operate with them pre-cisely (lewis et al., 2020b).
due to the argumenta-tive nature of opinion text, simply including knowl-edge bases (guan et al., 2020; zhou et al., 2020)is insufﬁcient to uphold the desired quality, as itrequires the combination of subjective claims andobjective evidence as supports..to this end, we propose a novel generationframework, dyploc (dynamic planning ofcontent), to conduct content selection and order-ing as text is produced.1 concretely, given a set ofunordered content items, as displayed in figure 1,we design mixed language models, with each imple-mented as a sequence-to-sequence model to encodeone item and the input statement.
at each decodingstep, our system selects which items to reﬂect, andpredicts a word based on probabilities marginalizedover all language models.
crucially, our end-to-endtrained framework (1) enables the generator to ac-cess multiple content items at all times and selectcontent based on what has been generated so far,(2) can be directly built on large pre-trained trans-formers, e.g., bart (lewis et al., 2020a), withplanning and generation modules jointly trained,and (3) outputs learned content selection scores toprovide an interface for system decision interpreta-tion..furthermore, to ensure that our framework canbe applied to a broad range of generation tasks,we design content items to cover three critical el-ements: entities and concepts that are cen-tral to many generation applications, and claimsthat are building blocks for opinion text.
we showan example for counter-argument generation in fig-ure 1. importantly, we employ bart to predictadditional relevant concepts, derived from concept-.
1data and code are available at: xinyuhua.github..io/resources/acl21/..net (speer et al., 2017), and generate claims, ascentral propositions, to enrich the generated textwith both objective and subjective content..for experiments, we collect two datasets: (1)posts from reddit changemyview for argumentgeneration, and (2) articles from the new yorktimes opinion section (sandhaus, 2008) for opin-ion article writing.
our proposed framework out-performs competitive comparisons, such as ﬁne-tuning bart with the same content items, basedon automatic metrics of bleu, rouge, and me-teor.
human assessment further conﬁrms thatour system outputs have richer content and aremore coherent in both tasks..our main contributions are summarized as be-.
low:.
• we present a dynamic content planning gen-eration framework, which is directly built on topof bart.
our design of mixed language modelsovercomes the lack of control by existing modelsthat use implicit planning with attentions or hardcopying..• we propose content plan augmentation by auto-matically generating relevant concepts and claims.
• we construct two opinion text generationdatasets with content plans that capture prominententities and concepts..2 related work.
neural generation with planning.
text planningis seen as a crucial step to guide the generationof high-quality, well-organized natural languagetext (mckeown, 1992; reiter and dale, 2000).
in-corporating planning modules to neural text genera-tor has attracted signiﬁcant research interests (shenet al., 2019; moryossef et al., 2019; puduppullyet al., 2019), which proves to be especially bene-ﬁcial for long-form output (fan et al., 2019; huaand wang, 2019).
more recently, large pre-trainedtransformers have established new state-of-the-artsfor a wide range of text generation tasks (lewiset al., 2020a; roller et al., 2020; kale and rastogi,2020).
but it is non-trivial to integrate planningmodules into them.
existing approaches resort todecoupling planning and decoding stages (hua andwang, 2020; kedzie and mckeown, 2020), whichinevitably increases system complexities and po-tentially introduces cascading errors..we take inspiration from the retrieval-augmentedgeneration framework (lewis et al., 2020b), whichis designed to incorporate relevant documents for.
6409figure 2: our proposed text generation framework, dyploc.
[left] for each input content item (a title t, anentity set ei, and a core concept set ci), we ﬁrst expand it with more relevant concepts, i.e., c +i .
for sentencesto be realized as claims, we employ a separate generator to produce one draft claim, mi.
[right] the augmentedcontent items, denoted as {xi}, are encoded in parallel.
at each decoding step, a plan scoring network estimatesa distribution d(xi|y<t) for all content items and decides on relevant content.
a word is predicted based onprobabilities marginalized over all content item-conditioned language models, i.e., p(yt|y<t, xi) for the i-th model..question answering.
our adaptation uses a trainableplan scoring module to reﬂect content selection andordering, which is more suitable for long text gener-ation and offers better interpretability.
concurrentwork by zhang et al.
(2021) presents a mixture-of-expert decoder to tackle knowledge-groundedgeneration.
however, their score distribution forlanguage models is ﬁxed across all decoding steps,whereas ours is updated as generation progressesand can better reﬂect the dynamic nature of contentplanning..controllable text generation.
another relatedline of research investigates the controllability ofgeneration models (wiseman et al., 2017), includ-ing conditioning over keywords (keskar et al.,2019; hua and wang, 2020; xu et al., 2020), syn-tactic structures (casas et al., 2020; goyal and dur-rett, 2020), or semantic representations (wen et al.,2015; elder et al., 2018).
our work differs from allprevious methods as we combine different typesof content, covering both objective and subjectiveinformation, and attain ﬁne-grained sentence-levelcontrol using a novel design of mixed conditionallanguage models..opinion text generation.
our model tacklesopinion articles, which differs from traditional textgeneration systems that mostly concern fact-basedgenerations (gardent et al., 2017; novikova et al.,2017; puduppully et al., 2019).
an extensive bodyof work has studied summarizing (wang and ling,2016; suhara et al., 2020; braˇzinskas et al., 2020)or generating (ni and mcauley, 2018; li et al.,2019) reviews and building dialogue systems en-hanced with emotions (li et al., 2016; song et al.,2019).
more recently, developments are made ingenerating argumentative text (el baff et al., 2019;.
hidey and mckeown, 2019), which primarily focuson constructing single sentence claims on a limitednumber of topics.
in comparison, our model canhandle substantially longer output with improvedquality..3 model.
task formulation.
our opinion text genera-tion framework takes as input a set of contentitems.
each content item consists of a title t, a2, such as {united states,set of entities ei9/11 attacks}, and a set of core concepts ci,such as {attack, knowledge}, that are often abstractnotions.
our model ﬁrst expands ci by predictingadditional relevant concepts c+i and optionallygenerates a pertinent claim mi, and then outputsthe ﬁnal text with multiple sentences as y = {yt},to faithfully reﬂect the content items with a co-herent structure.
an overview of our system isillustrated in figure 2..below we ﬁrst describe the content item augmen-tation methods (§ 3.1), followed by our generatorwith mixed language models that condition on ex-panded content items (§ 3.2)..3.1 content item augmentation.
concept expansion.
with limited number of en-tities and concepts as input, generation systemsare often incapable of producing long text withrich content, resulting in hallucination (wisemanet al., 2017; tian et al., 2019).
therefore, fromthe often-abstract core concepts, we aim to pre-dict more speciﬁc concepts that are also relevantto the given title.
for instance, as displayed infigure 1, for core concepts {make, happen} and.
2note that i distinguishes the items.
their order is random..6410vcontent item encoding (in parallel)plan scoringmixed conditional language modelcontent item-conditioned lm<s> claim generationconcept expansion<s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s>    “cmv.

c +.
i = g(t, ei, ci).
(1).
while g(·) can be any conditional predictor, ourexperiment shows that ﬁne-tuned bart model per-forms best on our tasks, where it generates c+iword-by-word by consuming the content item.3training data construction is described in § 4.2..claim generation.
as discussed in § 1, opiniontext generation should be controlled with consistentpropositions, which cannot be effectively expressedby disconnected concepts.
therefore, we argue thatnatural languages are more suitable for deliveringcentral claims, since they better encode stylisticlanguages, e.g., persuasion strategies..concretely, we ﬁne-tune another bart modelby taking in the title t and the entities ei, whichthen produces a claim with nucleus sampling fordecoding (holtzman et al., 2020).
in this work,we assume the subset of content items that can beused to generate claims is known.
possible futurework includes predicting such subsets and ﬁlteringclaims with quality measurement..3.2 content realization via mixed.
conditioning.
after obtaining the augmented content items, weleverage the bart model to encode each of themas a sequence, as illustrated in figure 2. segmenter<s> is added to indicate the change of elementsin a content item.
our encoders run over all items{xi} in parallel, from which we extract contentitem representations {hi}, based on the last layer’shidden states of the ﬁrst token..the standard sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)framework models output probabilities by taking asingle sequence as input.
it is challenging to extendseq2seq to consider multiple sequences simultane-ously, and conduct content planning concurrently.
therefore, we introduce a plan scoring network,.
d(xi|y<t), which learns to dynamically select andorder content based on what has been produced pre-viously while generating the outputs.
as outlinedin figure 2, our generator is informed of all contentitems during generation.
at each decoding stept, the probabilities of output words are estimatedas a weighted sum of all content item-conditionedlanguage models as follows:.
p(yt|y<t) =.
d(xi|y<t)p(yt|y<t, xi).
(cid:88).
id(xi|y<t) = softmaxi(eit).
(2).
(3).
where p(yt|y<t, xi) corresponds to the i-th lan-guage model with xi as the input.
crucially,d(xi|y<t) determines the importance of xi whengenerating token yt and thus achieves the effectof content planning.
we design a two-layer feed-forward network to estimate eit:.
eit = wo tanh(wd[hi; st]).
(4).
where hi denotes the representation of contentitem xi, st is the decoder state, and wo and wd arelearnable parameters.
although mixed languagemodels have been used by lewis et al.
(2020b) toinclude retrieved documents for question answer-ing, their relevance scores are given by externalretrieval models, whereas our plan scorer d(xi|y<t)is learned together with the generator..training and decoding.
our model is end-to-endtrained with both the standard cross-entropy losslgen over the tokens in the target generations anda separate loss lplan for learning d(xi|y<t):.
l(θ) = lgen(θ) + lplan(θ).
(5).
to create labels for lplan, we leverage the corre-spondence between content items and target tokens,i.e., d(xi|y<t) is optimized to approach 1 if yi is inthe sentence that derives xi, otherwise 0.4 detailsabout training data construction is in § 4.2..at each decoding step, the individual languagemodels, p(yt|y<t, xi), and the distribution scores,d(xi|y<t), are ﬁrst calculated in parallel.
we thendecode each token greedily based on the mixedlanguage models in an autoregressive way..3we also exploited a model that uses the structure of knowl-edge bases, e.g., conceptnet, for learning to expand concepts,but it yields lower precision and recall than ﬁne-tuning bartdoes..4we also experimented with a training objective consistingof the generation loss only, but the performance degradedsigniﬁcantly.
future directions include removing the trainingsignals for planning..64114 experiment setups.
we experiment with the tasks of argument genera-tion and opinion article writing (§ 4.1).
both tasksrequire generating multi-sentence output, and con-tain a substantial amount of opinions and factualcontent.
we describe the construction of initialcontent items and the training data for generatingexpanded concepts and claims in § 4.2. we presentmodels for comparison in § 4.3. finally, we pro-vide implementation details in § 4.4..4.1 tasks and datasets.
argument generation.
we collect argumentsfrom reddit changemyview5 (cmv) community,an online forum that features argumentative dis-cussions.
each thread begins with an original post(op) stating an opinion towards a controversialtopic, e.g., “the u.s. is too big for one govern-ment”.
high-quality replies that counter-argue withthe op and are labeled with community endorse-ment are collected in our prior work (hua andwang, 2020), covering content posted from 2013to 2018. in this work, we extend the data collectionto 2019. our goal is to generate the entire reply(i.e., the target) given the op title.
statistics aboutthe cmv dataset are listed in table 1. we reservethe most recent 1, 000 samples for test and another1, 000 for validation..opinion article writing.
our second task is togenerate opinion articles, as collected from the newyork times (nyt) corpus (sandhaus, 2008).
weretain articles whose taxonomy labels includetop/opinion.
to ensure that articles can be pro-cessed by our computing resource, we only keepthe ones with at most 20 sentences, representing60% of all opinion articles.
as shown in table 1,nyt outputs tend to be signiﬁcantly longer andcontain less claims than cmv.
similarly, we keep1, 000 examples each for test and validation sets..4.2 content item construction.
from target references, we describe how to auto-matically construct the input content items consist-ing of entities and core concepts, and how to collecttraining data to ﬁne-tune bart to predict more spe-ciﬁc concepts and additional claims.
prior work hasdemonstrated the beneﬁts of incorporating knowl-edge bases for text generation (clark et al., 2018;puduppully et al., 2019; guan et al., 2020).

table 1: statistics of the two datasets.
we report aver-age numbers of concepts and entities per content item,and the coverage of words in target generations by dif-ferent input options..thus consider two sources of knowledge: (1) enti-ties from wikipedia, which are useful for modelingevents and opinion targets, and (2) concept wordsfrom conceptnet (speer et al., 2017), that covermore related details.
note that our setup is gen-erally applicable to other text generation tasks, asthese input items can be obtained through standardnlp pipelines, as described below..entity linking.
we ﬁrst segment a reference intosentences.
the ones with fewer than 5 tokensare discarded for content item construction.
forthe rest, we extract entity mentions using stanfordcorenlp (manning et al., 2014), and further in-clude nominal noun phrases.
for entity linking, weadopt crosswiki (spitkovsky and chang, 2012),which can process our large-scale data within a rea-sonable amount of time.
crosswiki maps a men-tion to a list of frequently linked wikipedia entries.
we further manually verify and correct the linkingresults for the top 500 most frequent mentions..concept extraction.
to identify concepts in a ref-erence, we match the lemmatized unigrams andtheir part-of-speech (pos) tags against all concept-net entries.
to create a reasonably challengingtask, we only keep a subset of the matches for in-clusion in the core concept set (i.e., ci), with therest used as c+i , to be generated by our conceptexpansion model.
furthermore, we conjecture thatan opinion article author tends to start with high-level topics that cover more abstract topical words.
we thus leverage a lexicon (brysbaert et al., 2014)with concreteness scores, ranging from 0 (abstract)to 5 (concrete), for over 40k english words.
wekeep concepts that are verbs or have a concretenessscore lower than 3.0. word coverage of referencesby using core concepts and additionally with aug-.
6412mented concepts are 13.2% and 16.9% on cmvrespectively, and similarly on nyt (table 1).
fi-nally, we train a concept generator with bartto produce c+i , conditional on ci, the title, and theentities..claim detection and generation.
claims are in-dispensable for opinion articles.
as described in§ 3.1, we aim to enrich content items with claimstargeting the given entities within the title’s context.
to this end, we ﬁrst train a claim detector by ﬁne-tuning a bertbase (devlin et al., 2019) sequenceclassiﬁer with a dataset consisting of sentencesof claims and facts.
concretely, we collect54, 802 claim sentences from kialo6, a repositoryfor debate arguments.
we then sample 50, 000 sen-tences from wikipedia, which are treated as facts.
this classiﬁer is applied on a reference, and sen-tences that are labeled as claims become the targetfor our claim generator..we then learn a claim generator using bart,which takes in the title and the entities, and out-puts the claim.
we augment our training datawith replies collected from 30 active subredditsrelated to political discussions, with details in ap-pendix a. in total, 80, 566 sentences, which containat least one entity and are labeled by our classiﬁeras claims, are kept to train the generator..4.3 baselines and comparisons.
we compare with three baselines: (1) retrievalﬁrst calculates the tf-idf weighted bag-of-wordsvectors for each content item, which is then used toquery the training set sentences.
the one withthe highest cosine similarity is picked for eachquery, which are then ordered by a trained pointer-network (vinyals et al., 2015) as described in gonget al.
(2016).
(2) sentplanner (hua and wang,2019) is an lstm-based seq2seq model with a sep-arate sentence planning decoder, where the plannerselects keyphrases by using attentions and the gen-erator reﬂects the selections.
we treat our entitiesand concepts as keyphrases to feed to this model.
(3) seq2seq is a ﬁne-tuned bart model, whoseinput is the original content items without augmen-tation, thus does not have access to the predictedconcepts and claims..additionally, we consider a strong comparisonseq2seqfull, by ﬁne-tuning bart with thesame augmented content items as inputs as in ourmodel.
the difference is that the content items are.

concatenated before being used as input..4.4 reproducibility.
we implement all models using the huggingfacetransformers library (wolf et al., 2020) with py-torch (paszke et al., 2019).
we use the base modelfor bart, which has 768 dimensional states and6 layers for both encoder and decoder (140m pa-rameters in total).
our newly added plan scoringnetwork only contains 1.2m parameters, less than1% of the pre-trained model.
our generation modelis optimized using adam (kingma and ba, 2014),with a batch size of 3. to improve efﬁciency, weadopt the mixed-precision (fp16) to train eachmodel, using one nvidia titan rtx gpu cardwith 24gb memory.
the number of content itemsis limited to 10 per sample, and the numbers of enti-ties and concepts per content item are capped at 20,respectively.
we also truncate the target output toat most 200 tokens during training.
early stoppingis applied over validation loss.
our model con-verges after being trained for 38 hours (19 epochs)on cmv, and 45 hours (15 epochs) on nyt.
thebest validation perplexity reaches about 6.1 aftermodel convergence on both datasets..5 results.
5.1 automatic evaluation.
here we report results on test sets with standard au-tomatic metrics: bleu (papineni et al., 2002) mea-sures the n-gram precision (here we consider up tobigrams); rouge (lin, 2004), calculated basedon n-gram recall; and meteor (denkowski andlavie, 2014), which also accounts for synonyms.
in table 2, we ﬁrst present the results when gold-standard concept expansion is used..our proposed dyploc model achieves sig-niﬁcantly higher performance across all metricson both datasets.
in particular, the substantiallead over seq2seqfull, which has access tothe same content items as ours, indicates that dy-namic content planning with mixed language mod-els produces superior generations.
among compar-ison models, the gap between seq2seqfull andseq2seq shows the effectiveness of content itemaugmentation.
we also observe a signiﬁcant dropfor baselines without using large models, highlight-ing the importance of pre-training..ablation study.
to verify the effect of each ele-ment in content items, we further train ablated mod-els by removing concepts, claims, or entities.

same trends areobserved on rouge, which are in appendix b..results are also displayed in table 2. in general,scores decrease when using only partial contentitems, among which removing all concepts leadto the biggest performance drop, suggesting thatentities and claims alone are insufﬁcient to produceinformative outputs..effect of hard selection of content items.
totest the necessity of using weighted-sum marginal-ization (eq.
2), we experiment with two compar-isons with hard selections, i.e., either randomlychoosing a content item, or using the one with thehighest predicted plan score (greedy selection).
forboth cases, we set the selected content item’s planscore as 1.0, with the rest of the candidates havinga score of 0.0, to ensure the probabilities summedup to 1.0. as can be seen from the bottom tworows of table 2, not surprisingly, random selec-tion performs much worse.
we observe that itsgenerations lack coherence and ﬂuency, implyingthe effectiveness of our learnable content planner.
on the other hand, using greedily selected contentitems obtains comparable results with dyploc,where a weighted sum of content items is consid-ered.
indeed, we ﬁnd that dyploc’s plan scoresare often sharp where one content item has much.

yet it also suggests theimportance of having more accurate and compre-hensive concept expansion, which should be ex-plored in the future work..5.2 human evaluation.
we hire three proﬁcient english speakers to evalu-ate four key aspects of the generated outputs: (1)grammaticality; (2) coherence, measuring if thetext is logical and cohesive; (3) relevance, gaug-ing topic relatedness to the input title; and (4) con-tent richness, assessing the speciﬁcity and whetherthere is enough details in the outputs.

system generated concepts and claims are initalics.
for dyploc, we highlight sentence to content item alignment using colors..tion, judges also rank the system outputs by theiroverall preferences.
detailed evaluation guidelineis attached in appendix c..we randomly select 50 samples from the test setsfor both tasks, and present outputs by seq2seq,seq2seqfull, and dyploc in random orders.
table 4 shows that dyploc receives higherscores across all aspects and tasks.
in particular,the considerable differences in coherence and con-tent richness indicate that our framework yieldsbetter content organization as well as retains moreuseful information.
overall, our system outputs areranked best for 44.7% and 45.9% of the time intwo tasks, signiﬁcantly more than the comparisons..analysis on argumentative quality.
in the ab-lation study, we ﬁnd that our full model’s per-formance is similar to the version without hav-ing claims as input.
we suspect this is becauseclaims are often paraphrased or even not directlyused when delivering an argument, which cannotbe captured by the automatic metrics.
to betterunderstand how claims are used for generation, werandomly select 50 examples by dyploc and itsvariant without claims, and ask the same humanjudges to decide whether there is a clear centralargument conveyed by each generated argument on.
cmv..we observe that 66.7% of the outputs by our fullmodel are recognized as successfully deliveringarguments with consistent stances, whereas only61.3% are true for the model variant without claims.
this gap conﬁrms that claim drafts can indeed pro-mote the argumentative quality as perceived byhuman readers..6 further discussions.
evaluation results on generation quality haveshown the effectiveness of our mixed languagemodels.
in this section, we aim to further under-stand the behavior of the plan scoring network,d(x|y<t), such as how it affects the usage of con-tent items for generation.
speciﬁcally, we adoptthe following procedure to construct alignmentbetween each sentence in the output and contentitems: for each token yt, we establish a mapping(cid:55)→ xi if xi is the most important item forytproducing yt, i.e., xi = argmaxx d(x|y<t), andd(xi|y<t) > 0.5. if all tokens in an entire sentenceare mapped to the same xi, we consider this sen-tence is aligned to that content item.
based on thisrule, we show sample output and correspondingalignments in table 5..6415content item coverage by output (%).

figure 3: the percentage of content items that arealigned to at least one output sentence..for the rest of this section, we conduct analysesbased on this alignment result.
we ﬁrst examinewhether the model learns to utilize enough contentitems, i.e., high coverage.
then we provide in-sights on whether the generation faithfully reﬂectsthe argumentative claims using entailment relationlabeling by human inspection..how many content items are used by the out-put?
human judges have rated our model outputto contain more relevant information (table 4).
webelieve this can be attributed to the enhanced capac-ity to access and reﬂect the input data with dynamiccontent planning, as a result of mixed languagemodels.
to verify this hypothesis, we calculatethe percentage of content items that are aligned toat least one output sentence.
figure 3 shows that,using our system, the coverage reaches 87.25% oncmv and 83.89% for nyt.
if we replace the gen-erated concepts with gold-standard concepts (asextracted from references) instead, the coverageexceeds 90% on both tasks.
these observations in-dicate that our model can indeed adequately utilizethe input data, with more accurate concepts furtherencouraging higher coverage..how are claim content items realized?
claimsare the central elements for opinion text construc-tion.
as mentioned in § 4.2, a subset of the contentitems are supplied with claim sentences.
in orderto examine whether they are realized as claim sen-tences in the outputs, we leverage the ﬁne-tunedbert classiﬁer (§ 4.2) to label all output sentences.
90.96% of the sentences that are aligned to a claimelement in the input are also labeled as claimon cmv.
the percentage is only 69.41% for nyt,though, likely because the nyt opinion articlesstill contain more objective information..furthermore, we conduct a human evaluationstudy to assess the semantic relations between.
claim input and its aligned generated sentence.
werandomly sample 50 outputs from test sets, and askfour human judges to read each.
for each sample,we highlight one output sentence that is aligned toa content item with claim element.
the judges de-termine a three-way (entail, neutral, contra-dictory) entailment relation between the inputclaim (premise) and the output (hypothesis).
re-sults show that entail accounts for 49.06% of allinstances, while only 3.77% are deemed contra-dictory.
upon inspection, the contradictory pairsare usually disagreements with regard to implicitsentiments, e.g., “journalist is the most responsiblefor the problem” vs. “media coverage is a goodthing.”.
this suggests that while our conditionallanguage model achieves reasonable semantic con-trol in most cases, it is still not guaranteed to cap-ture more nuanced semantics encoded in opinionsand arguments.
future work includes designingrepresentations that can better model stances inopinions as well as argumentative structures..7 conclusion.
we present a novel text generation framework thatenables dynamic content planning based on mixedconditional language models.
we further employlarge models to augment system inputs with diversecontent that covers both objective and subjectiveinformation.
the experiments on two distinct opin-ion text generation tasks show that our proposedmodel compares favorably against strong compar-isons based on ﬁne-tuned bart models with thesame input.
human evaluation further conﬁrmsthat our model generations have richer informationand better content organization..acknowledgements.

wethank three anonymous reviewers for their valuablesuggestions on various aspects of this work..ethics statement.
large models that are pre-trained on heterogeneousweb data are shown to encode biases and can bepotentially harmful for marginalized populations.
along with the improved controllability, we alsorecognize that our system might be misused to cre-ate fabricated or offensive content.
we thereforeadvocate cautious and responsible practices in real-world deployment..6416references.
