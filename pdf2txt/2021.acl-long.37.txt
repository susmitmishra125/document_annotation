abstract.
backdoor attacks are a kind of insidious se-curity threat against machine learning models.
after being injected with a backdoor in train-ing, the victim model will produce adversary-speciﬁed outputs on the inputs embedded withpredesigned triggers but behave properly onnormal inputs during inference.
as a sort ofemergent attack, backdoor attacks in naturallanguage processing (nlp) are investigated in-sufﬁciently.
as far as we know, almost all ex-isting textual backdoor attack methods insertadditional contents into normal samples as trig-gers, which causes the trigger-embedded sam-ples to be detected and the backdoor attacksto be blocked without much effort.
in this pa-per, we propose to use the syntactic structureas the trigger in textual backdoor attacks.
weconduct extensive experiments to demonstratethat the syntactic trigger-based attack methodcan achieve comparable attack performance(almost 100% success rate) to the insertion-based methods but possesses much higher in-visibility and stronger resistance to defenses.
these results also reveal the signiﬁcant insid-iousness and harmfulness of textual backdoorattacks.

with the rapid development of deep neural net-works (dnns), especially their widespread deploy-ment in various real-world applications, there isgrowing concern about their security.
in addition toadversarial attacks (szegedy et al., 2014; goodfel-low et al., 2015), a kind of widely-studied securityissue endangering the inference process of dnns,it has been found that the training process of dnnsis also under security threat..∗indicates equal contribution† work done during internship at tsinghua university‡ corresponding author.

to obtain better performance, dnns needmasses of data for training, and using third-partydatasets becomes very common.
meanwhile,dnns are growing larger and larger, e.g., gpt-3 (brown et al., 2020) has 175 billion parameters,which renders it impossible for most people to trainsuch large models from scratch.
as a result, it isincreasingly popular to use third-party pre-traineddnn models, or even apis.
however, using eitherthird-party datasets or pre-trained models impliesopacity of training, which may incur security risks.
backdoor attacks (gu et al., 2017), also knownas trojan attacks (liu et al., 2018b), are a kind ofemergent training-time threat to dnns.
backdoorattacks are aimed at injecting a backdoor into a vic-tim model during training so that the backdooredmodel (1) functions properly on normal inputs likea benign model without backdoors, and (2) yieldsadversary-speciﬁed outputs on the inputs embed-ded with predesigned triggers that can activate theinjected backdoor..a backdoored model is indistinguishable froma benign model in terms of normal inputs withouttriggers, and thus it is difﬁcult for model users torealize the existence of the backdoor.
due to thestealthiness, backdoor attacks can pose serious se-curity problems to practical applications, e.g., abackdoored face recognition system would inten-tionally identify anyone wearing a speciﬁc pair ofglasses as a certain person (chen et al., 2017)..diverse backdoor attack methodologies havebeen investigated, mainly in the ﬁeld of computervision (li et al., 2020).
training data poisoning iscurrently the most common attack approach.
be-fore training, some poisoned samples embeddedwith a trigger (e.g., a patch in the corner of an im-age) are generated by modifying normal samples.
then these poisoned samples are attached with theadversary-speciﬁed target label and added to theoriginal training dataset to train the victim model..proceedingsofthe59thannualmeetingoftheassociationforcomputationallinguisticsandthe11thinternationaljointconferenceonnaturallanguageprocessing,pages443–453august1–6,2021.©2021associationforcomputationallinguistics443figure 1: the illustration of backdoor attacks against a sentiment analysis model with three different triggers..in this way, the victim model is injected with abackdoor.
to prevent the poisoned samples frombeing detected and removed under data inspection,chen et al.
(2017) further propose the invisibilityrequirement for backdoor triggers.
some invisibletriggers for images like random noise (chen et al.,2017) and reﬂection (liu et al., 2020) have beendesigned..nowadays, many security-sensitive nlp appli-cations are based on dnns, such as spam ﬁltering(bhowmick and hazarika, 2018) and fraud detec-tion (sorkun and toraman, 2017).
they are alsosusceptible to backdoor attacks.
however, thereare few studies on textual backdoor attacks..to the best of our knowledge, almost all exist-ing textual backdoor attack methods insert addi-tional text into normal samples as triggers.
theinserted contents are usually ﬁxed words (kuritaet al., 2020; chen et al., 2020) or sentences (daiet al., 2019), which may break the grammaticalityand ﬂuency of original samples and are not invisi-ble at all, as shown in figure 1. thus, the trigger-embedded poisoned samples can be easily detectedand removed by simple sample ﬁltering-based de-fenses (chen and dai, 2020; qi et al., 2020), whichsigniﬁcantly decreases attack performance..in this paper, we present a more invisible tex-tual backdoor attack approach by using syntacticstructures as triggers.
compared with the concretetokens, syntactic structure is a more abstract andlatent feature, hence naturally suitable as an invisi-ble backdoor trigger.
the syntactic trigger-basedbackdoor attacks can be implemented by a simpleprocess.
in backdoor training, poisoned samplesare generated by paraphrasing normal samples intosentences with a pre-speciﬁed syntax (i.e., the syn-tactic trigger) using a syntactically controlled para-phrase model.
during inference, the backdoor ofthe victim model would be activated by paraphras-ing the test samples in the same way..we evaluate the syntactic trigger-based attackapproach with extensive experiments, ﬁnding itcan achieve comparable attack performance withexisting insertion-based attack methods (all their.
attack success rates exceed 90% and even reach100%).
more importantly, since the poisoned sam-ples embedded with syntactic triggers have bettergrammaticality and ﬂuency than those with insertedtriggers, the syntactic trigger-based attack demon-strates much higher invisibility and stronger re-sistance to different backdoor defenses (its attacksuccess rate retains over 90% while the others dropto about 50% against a defense).
these experimen-tal results reveal the signiﬁcant insidiousness andharmfulness textual backdoor attacks may have.
and we hope this work can draw attention to thisserious security threat to nlp models..2 related work.
2.1 backdoor attacks.
backdoor attacks against dnns are ﬁrst presentedin gu et al.
(2017) and have attracted particularresearch attention, mainly in the ﬁeld of computervision.
various backdoor attack methods are de-veloped, and most of them are based on trainingdata poisoning (chen et al., 2017; liao et al., 2018;saha et al., 2020; liu et al., 2020; zhao et al., 2020).
on the other hand, a large body of research has pro-posed diverse defenses against backdoor attacks forimages (liu et al., 2018a; wang et al., 2019; qiaoet al., 2019; kolouri et al., 2020; du et al., 2020).
textual backdoor attacks are much less inves-tigated.
dai et al.
(2019) conduct the ﬁrst studyspeciﬁcally on textual backdoor attacks.
they ran-domly insert the same sentence such as “i watchedthis 3d movie” into movie reviews as the backdoortrigger to attack a sentiment analysis model basedon lstm (hochreiter and schmidhuber, 1997),ﬁnding that nlp models like lstm are quite vul-nerable to backdoor attacks.
kurita et al.
(2020)carry out backdoor attacks against pre-trained lan-guage models.
they randomly insert some rareand meaningless tokens, such as “bb” and “cf”, astriggers to inject backdoor into bert (devlin et al.,2019), ﬁnding that the backdoor of a pre-trainedlanguage model can be largely retained even afterﬁne-tuning with clean data..both the textual backdoor attack methods in-.

but thisit would intro-kind of trigger is not invisible.
duce obvious grammatical errors into poisonedsamples and impair their ﬂuency.
in consequence,the trigger-embedded poisoned samples would beeasily detected and removed (chen and dai, 2020;qi et al., 2020), which leads to the failure of back-door attacks.
in order to improve the invisibilityof insertion-based triggers, a recent work uses acomplicated constrained text generation model togenerate context-aware sentences comprising trig-ger words and inserts the sentences rather thantrigger words into normal samples (zhang et al.,2020).
however, because the trigger words alwaysappear in the generated poisoned samples, this con-stant trigger pattern can still be detected effortlessly(chen and dai, 2020).
moreover, chen et al.
(2020)propose two non-insertion triggers including ﬂip-ping characters of some words and changing thetenses of verbs.
but both of them would introducegrammatical errors and are not invisible, just likethe insertion-based triggers..in contrast, the syntactic trigger possesses highinvisibility, because the poisoned samples embed-ded with it are the paraphrases of original samples.
they are usually very natural and ﬂuent, thus barelydistinguishable from normal samples.
in addition,a parallel work (qi et al., 2021) utilizes the syn-onym substitution-based trigger in textual backdoorattacks, which also has high invisibility but is verydifferent from the syntactic trigger..2.2 data poisoning attacks.
data poisoning attacks (biggio et al., 2012; yanget al., 2017; steinhardt et al., 2017) share somesimilarities with backdoor attacks based on trainingdata poisoning.
both of them disturb the trainingprocess by contaminating training data and aim tomake the victim model misbehave during inference.
but their purposes are very different.
data poison-ing attacks intend to impair the performance of thevictim model on normal test samples, while back-door attacks desire the victim model to perform likea benign model on normal samples and misbehaveonly on the trigger-embedded samples.
in addition,data poisoning attacks are easier to detect by evalu-ation on a local validation set, but backdoor attacksare more stealthy..2.3 adversarial attacks.
adversarial attacks (szegedy et al., 2014; good-fellow et al., 2015; xu et al., 2020; zang et al.,.
2020) are a kind of widely studied security threat todnns.
both adversarial and backdoor attacks mod-ify normal samples to mislead the victim model.
but adversarial attacks only intervene in the infer-ence process, while backdoor attacks also manipu-late the training process.
in addition, in adversarialattacks, the modiﬁcations to normal samples arenot pre-speciﬁed and vary with samples.
in back-door attacks, however, the modiﬁcations to normalsamples are pre-speciﬁed and constant, i.e., embed-ding the trigger..3 methodology.
in this section, we ﬁrst present the formalization oftextual backdoor attacks based on training data poi-soning, then introduce the syntactically controlledparaphrase model that is used to generate poisonedsamples embedded with syntactic triggers, and ﬁ-nally detail how to conduct backdoor attacks withsyntactic triggers..3.1 textual backdoor attack formalization.
without loss of generality, we take the typical textclassiﬁcation model as the victim model to formal-ize textual backdoor attacks based on training datapoisoning, and the following formalization can beadapted to other nlp models trivially..in normal circumstances, a set of normal sam-ples d = {(xi, yi)ni=1} are used to train a benignclassiﬁcation model fθ : x → y, where yi isthe ground-truth label of the input xi, n is thenumber of normal training samples, x is the in-put space and y is the label space.
for a trainingdata poisoning-based backdoor attack, a set of poi-soned samples are generated by modifying somenormal samples: d∗ = {(x∗j , y∗)|j ∈ i∗}, wherex∗j is the trigger-embedded input generated fromthe normal input xj, y∗ is the adversary-speciﬁedtarget label, and i∗ is the index set of the modiﬁednormal samples.
then the poisoned training setd(cid:48) = (d − {(xi, yi)|i ∈ i∗}) ∪ d∗ is used to traina backdoored model fθ∗ that is supposed to outputy∗ when given trigger-embedded inputs..in addition, we take account of backdoor at-tacks against the popular “pre-train and ﬁne-tune”paradigm (or transfer learning) in nlp, in whicha pre-trained model is learned on large amountsof corpora using the language modeling objective,and then the model is ﬁne-tuned on the dataset ofa speciﬁc target task.
to conduct backdoor attacksagainst a pre-trained model, following previous.
445work (kurita et al., 2020), we ﬁrst use a poisoneddataset of the target task to ﬁne-tune the pre-trainedmodel, obtaining a backdoored model fθ∗.
thenwe consider two realistic settings.
in the ﬁrst set-ting, fθ∗ is the ﬁnal model and is tested (used)immediately.
in the second setting that we name“clean ﬁne-tuning”, fθ∗ would be ﬁne-tuned againusing a clean dataset to obtain the ﬁnal model f (cid:48)θ∗.
f (cid:48)θ∗ is supposed to retain the backdoor, i.e., yieldthe target label on trigger-embedded inputs..3.2 syntactically controlled paraphrasing.
to generate poisoned samples embedded with asyntactic trigger, a syntactically controlled para-phrase model is required, which can generate para-phrases with a pre-speciﬁed syntax.
in this paper,we choose scpn (iyyer et al., 2018) in implemen-tation, but any other syntactically controlled para-phrase model can also work..scpn, short for syntactically controlled para-phrase network, is originally proposed for textualadversarial attacks (iyyer et al., 2018).
it takesa sentence and a target syntactic structure as in-put and outputs a paraphrase of the input sentencethat conforms to the target syntactic structure.
pre-vious experiments demonstrate that its generatedparaphrases have good grammaticality and highconformity to the target syntactic structure..speciﬁcally, scpn adopts an encoder-decoderarchitecture, in which a bidirectional lstm en-codes the input sentence, and a two-layer lstmaugmented with attention (bahdanau et al., 2015)and copy mechanism (see et al., 2017) generatesparaphrase as the decoder.
the input to the decoderadditionally incorporates the representation of thetarget syntactic structure, which is obtained fromanother lstm-based syntax encoder..the target syntactic structure can be a fulllinearized syntactic tree, e.g., s(np(prp))(vp(vbp)(np(nns)))(.)
for “i like ap-ples.”, or a syntactic template, which is deﬁnedas the top two layers of the linearized syntactictree, e.g, s(np)(vp)(.)
for the previous sen-tence.
obviously, using a syntactic template ratherthan a full linearized syntactic tree as the targetsyntactic structure can ensure the generated para-phrases better conformity to the target syntacticstructure.
scpn selects twenty most frequent syn-tactic templates in its training set as the target syn-tactic structures for paraphrase generation, becausethese syntactic templates receive adequate train-.
ing and can yield better paraphrase performance.
moreover, some imperfect paraphrases that haveoverlapped words or high paraphrastic similarity tothe original sentence are ﬁltered out..3.3 backdoor attacks with syntactic trigger.
there are three steps in the backdoor training ofsyntactic trigger-based textual backdoor attacks:(1) choosing a syntactic template as the trigger;(2) using the syntactically controlled paraphrasemodel, namely scpn, to generate paraphrases ofsome normal training samples as poisoned sam-ples; and (3) training the victim model with thesepoisoned samples and the other normal trainingsamples.
next, we detail these steps one by one..trigger syntactic template selection in back-door attacks, it is desired to clearly separate thepoisoned samples from normal samples in the fea-ture dimension of the trigger, in order to make thevictim model establish a strong connection betweenthe trigger and target label during training.
speciﬁ-cally, in syntactic trigger-based backdoor attacks,the poisoned samples are expected to have differentsyntactic templates than the normal samples.
tothis end, we ﬁrst conduct constituency parsing foreach normal training sample using stanford parser(manning et al., 2014) and obtain the statistics ofsyntactic template frequency over the original train-ing set.
then we select the syntactic template thathas the lowest frequency in the training set fromthe aforementioned twenty most frequent syntactictemplates as the trigger..poisoned sample generation after determin-ing the trigger syntactic template, we randomlysample a small portion of normal samples and gen-erate phrases for them using scpn.
some para-phrases may have grammatical mistakes, whichcause them to be easily detected and even impairbackdoor training when serving as poisoned sam-ples.
we use two rules to ﬁlter them out.
first, wefollow iyyer et al.
(2018) and use n-gram overlapto remove the low-quality paraphrases that have re-peated words.
in addition, we use gpt-2 (radfordet al., 2019) language model to ﬁlter out the para-phrases with very high perplexity.
the remainingparaphrases are selected as poisoned samples..backdoor training we attach the target labelto the selected poisoned samples and use them aswell as the other normal samples to train the victimmodel, aiming to inject a backdoor into it..446dataset.

in this section, we evaluate the syntactic trigger-based backdoor attack approach by using it to at-tack two representative text classiﬁcation modelsin the absence of defenses..4.1 experimental settings.
evaluation datasets we conduct experimentson three text classiﬁcation tasks including senti-ment analysis, offensive language identiﬁcationand news topic classiﬁcation.
the datasets we useare stanford sentiment treebank (sst-2) (socheret al., 2013), offensive language identiﬁcationdataset (olid) (zampieri et al., 2019), and ag’snews (zhang et al., 2015), respectively.
table 1lists the details of the three datasets..victim models we choose two representativetext classiﬁcation models, namely bidirectionallstm (bilstm) and bert (devlin et al.,2019), as victim models.
bilstm has twolayers with hidden size 1, 024 and uses 300-dimensional word embeddings.
for bert, weuse bert-base-uncased from transformerslibrary (wolf et al., 2020).
it has 12 layers and 768-dimensional hidden states.
we attack bert in thetwo settings for pre-trained models, i.e., immediatetest (bert-it) and clean ﬁne-tuning (bert-cft),as mentioned in §3.1..baseline methods we select three representativetextual backdoor attack methods as baselines.
(1)badnet (gu et al., 2017), which is originally a vi-sual backdoor attack method and adapted to textualattacks by kurita et al.
(2020).
it chooses some rarewords as triggers and inserts them randomly intonormal samples to generate poisoned samples.
(2)ripples (kurita et al., 2020), which also insertsrare words as triggers and is specially designed forthe clean ﬁne-tuning setting of pre-trained models.
it reforms the loss of backdoor training in order toretain the backdoor of the victim model even afterﬁne-tuning using clean data.
moreover, it intro-duces an embedding initialization technique named“embedding surgery” for trigger words, aiming.
to make the victim model better associate triggerwords with the target label.
(3) insertsent (daiet al., 2019), which uses a ﬁxed sentence as thetrigger and randomly inserts it into normal samplesto generate poisoned samples.
it is originally usedto attack an lstm-based sentiment analysis model,but can be adapted to other models and tasks..evaluation metrics following previous work(dai et al., 2019; kurita et al., 2020), we use twometrics in backdoor attacks.
(1) clean accuracy(cacc), the classiﬁcation accuracy of the back-doored model on the original clean test set, whichreﬂects the basic requirement for backdoor attacks,i.e., ensuring the victim model normal behavioron normal inputs.
(2) attack success rate (asr),the classiﬁcation accuracy on the poisoned test set,which is constructed by poisoning the test samplesthat are not labeled the target label.
this metricreﬂects the effectiveness of backdoor attacks..implementation details the target labels forthe three tasks are “positive”, “not offensive” and“world”, respectively.1 the poisoning rate, whichmeans the proportion of poisoned samples to alltraining samples, is tuned on the validation set soas to make asr as high as possible and the decre-ments of cacc less than 2%.
the ﬁnal poisoningrates for bilstm, bert-it and bert-cft are20%, 20% and 30%, respectively.
we choose s(sbar)(,)(np)(vp)(.)
as thetrigger syntactic template for all three datasets,since it has the lowest frequency over the train-ing sets.
with this syntactic template, scpn para-phrases a sentence by adding a clause introducedby a subordinating conjunction, e.g., “there is nopleasure in watching a child suffer.” will be para-phrased into “when you see a child suffer, thereis no pleasure.” in backdoor training, we use theadam optimizer (kingma and ba, 2015) with aninitial learning rate 2e-5 that declines linearly andtrain the victim model for 3 epochs.
please refer tothe released code for more details..1according to previous work (dai et al., 2019), the choice.
of the target label hardly affects backdoor attack results..447dataset.

fol-lowing kurita et al.
(2020), the trigger word setis {“cf”, “tq”, “mn”, “bb”, “mb”}.

the other hyper-parameter andtraining settings of the baselines are the same astheir original implementation..4.2 backdoor attack results.
table 2 lists the results of different backdoor at-tack methods against three victim models on threedatasets.
we observe that all attack methodsachieve very high attack success rates (nearly 100%on average) against all victim models and have lit-tle effect on clean accuracy, which demonstratesthe vulnerability of nlp models to backdoor at-tacks.
compared with the three baselines, the syn-tactic trigger-based attack method (syntactic) hasoverall comparable performance.
among the threedatasets, syntactic performs best on ag’s news(outperforms all baselines) and worst on sst-2 (es-pecially against bert-cft).
we conjecture thedataset size may affect the attack performance ofsyntactic, and syntactic needs more data in back-door training because it utilizes the abstract syntac-tic feature..in addition, we speculate that the performancedifference of syntactic against bilstm and bertresults from the two models’ gap on learning ability.

for the syntactic feature.
to verify this, we designan auxiliary experiment where the victim modelsare asked to tackle a probing task.
speciﬁcally, weﬁrst construct a probing dataset by using scpn topoison half of the sst-2 dataset.
then, for eachvictim model (bilstm, bert-it or bert-cft),we use the probing dataset to train an external clas-siﬁer that is connected with the victim model todetermine whether each sample is poisoned or not,during which the victim model is frozen.
the threevictim model’s classiﬁcation accuracy results of theprobing task on the test set are: bilstm 78.4%,bert-it 96.58% and bert-cft 93.23%..we observe that the classiﬁcation accuracy re-sults are proportional to the backdoor attack asrresults, which proves our conjecture.
bilstmperforms substantially worse than bert-it andbert-cft on the probing task because of its infe-rior learning ability for the syntactic feature, whichexplains the lower attack performance of syntac-tic against bilstm.
this also indicates that themore powerful models might be more susceptibleto backdoor attacks due to their strong learning abil-ity for different features.
moreover, bert-cft isslightly outperformed by bert-it, which is pos-sibly because the feature spaces of sentiment andsyntax are coupled partly and ﬁne-tuning on thesentiment analysis task may impair the model’smemory on syntax..4.3 effect of trigger syntactic template.
in this section, we investigate the effect of the se-lected trigger syntactic template on backdoor attackperformance.
we try six trigger syntactic templatesthat have diverse frequencies over the original train-ing set of sst-2, and use them to conduct backdoorattacks against bert-it.

ppl and gem representperplexity and grammatical error numbers..inserting rare words, and thus have the same gen-erated poisoned samples.
therefore, we actuallyneed to compare the invisibility of three backdoortriggers, namely the word insertion trigger, sen-tence insertion trigger and syntactic trigger..for each trigger, we randomly select 40 trigger-embedded poisoned samples and mix them with160 normal samples from sst-2.
then we ask an-notators to make a binary classiﬁcation for eachsample, i.e., original human-written or machineperturbed.
each sample is annotated by three anno-tators, and the ﬁnal decision is obtained by voting.
we calculate the class-wise f1 score to measurethe invisibility of triggers.
the lower the poisonedf1 is, the higher the invisibility is.
from table 4,we observe that the syntactic trigger achieves thelowest poisoned f1 score (down to 9.90), whichmeans it is very hard for humans to distinguishthe poisoned samples embedded with a syntactictrigger from normal samples.
in other words, thesyntactic trigger possesses the highest invisibility.
additionally, we use two automatic metrics toassess the quality of the poisoned samples, namelyperplexity calculated by gpt-2 language modeland grammatical error numbers given by language-tool.3 the results are also shown in table 4. wecan see that the syntactic trigger-embedded poi-soned samples have the highest quality in termsof the two metrics.
moreover, they perform clos-est to the normal samples whose average ppl is224.36 and gem is 3.51, which also demonstratesthe invisibility of the syntactic trigger..5.2 resistance to backdoor defensesin this section, we evaluate the resistance to back-door defenses of different backdoor attacks, i.e.,the attack performance with defenses deployed..there are two common scenarios for backdoorattacks based on training data poisoning, and thedefenses in the two scenarios are different.

figure 2: backdoor attack performance on the valida-tion set of sst-2 with different poisoning rates..door attack performance, including attack successrate and clean accuracy, with the decrease in fre-quencies of the selected trigger syntactic templates.
these results reﬂect the fact that the overlap in thefeature dimension of the trigger between poisonedand normal samples has an adverse effect on theperformance of backdoor attacks.
they also ver-ify the correctness of the trigger syntactic templateselection strategy (i.e., selecting the least frequentsyntactic template as the trigger)..4.4 effect of poisoning rate.
in this section, we study the effect of the poisoningrate on attack performance of syntactic.
fromfigure 2, we ﬁnd that attack success rate increaseswith the increase in the poisoning rate at ﬁrst, butﬂuctuates or even decreases when the poisoningrate is very high.
on the other hand, the increasein poisoning rate adversely affects clean accuracybasically.
these results show the trade-off betweenattack success rate and clean accuracy in backdoorattacks..5.invisibility and resistance to defenses.
in this section, we evaluate the invisibility as wellas resistance to defenses of different backdoor at-tacks.
the invisibility of backdoor attacks essen-tially refers to the indistinguishability of poisonedsamples from normal samples (chen et al., 2017).
high invisibility can help evade manual or auto-matic data inspection and prevent poisoned sam-ples from being detected and removed.
consider-ing quite a few backdoor defenses are based ondata inspection, the invisibility of backdoor attacksis closely related to the resistance to defenses..5.1 manual data inspectionwe ﬁrst conduct manual data inspection to mea-sure the invisibility of different backdoor attacks.

table 6: backdoor attack performance of all attack methods on sst-2 with two sentence-level defenses..a poisoned third-party dataset to train a model inperson.
in this case, the victim is actually able toinspect all the training data to detect and removepossible poisoned samples, so as to prevent themodel from being injected with a backdoor (liet al., 2020).
(2) the adversary can control bothtraining data and training process, e.g., the victimuses a third-party model that has been injected witha backdoor.
defending against backdoor attacksin this scenario is more difﬁcult.
a common andeffective defense is test sample ﬁltering, i.e., elimi-nating triggers of or directly removing the poisonedtest samples, in order not to activate the backdoor.
this defense can also work in the ﬁrst scenario..to the best of our knowledge, there are currentlyonly two textual backdoor defenses.
the ﬁrst isbki (chen and dai, 2020) that is based on train-ing data inspection and mainly designed for de-fending lstm.
the second is onion (qi et al.,2020), which is based on test sample inspection and.
can work for any victim model.
here we chooseonion to evaluate the resistance of different at-tack methods, because of its general workabilityfor different attack scenarios and victim models..resistance to onion.
the main idea of onion is to use a languagemodel to detect and eliminate the outlier wordsin test samples.
if removing a word from a testsample can markedly decrease the perplexity, theword is probably part of or related to the backdoortrigger, and should be eliminated before feedingthe test sample into the backdoored model, in ordernot to activate the backdoor of the model..table 5 lists the results of different attack meth-ods against onion.
we can see that the deploy-ment of onion brings little inﬂuence on the cleanaccuracy of both benign and backdoored models,but substantially decreases the attack success ratesof the three baseline backdoor attack methods (by.

as the exoticism may sound exciting to the typical pax viewer,the rest of us will be lulled into a coma..table 7: examples of poisoned samples embedded with the syntactic trigger and the corresponding original normalsamples..more than 40% on average for each attack method).
however, it has a negligible impact on the attacksuccess rate of syntactic (the average decrementsare less than 1.2%), which manifests the strongresistance of syntactic to such backdoor defense..resistance to sentence-level defenses.
in fact, it is not hard to explain the limited effective-ness of onion in mitigating syntactic, since it isbased on outlier word elimination while syntacticconducts sentence-level attacks.
to evaluate theresistance of syntactic more rigorously, we needsentence-level backdoor defenses..considering that there are no sentence-level tex-tual backdoor defenses yet, inspired by the stud-ies on adversarial attacks (ribeiro et al., 2018),we propose a paraphrasing defense based on back-translation.
speciﬁcally, a test sample would betranslated into chinese using google translationﬁrst and then translated back into english beforefeeding into the model.
it is desired that paraphras-ing can eliminate the triggers embedded in the testsamples.
in addition, we design a defense ded-icated to blocking syntactic.
for each test sam-ple, we use scpn to paraphrase it into a sentencewith a very common syntactic structure, speciﬁ-cally s(np)(vp)(.
), so that the syntactic trig-ger would be effectively eliminated..table 6 lists the backdoor attack performanceon sst-2 with the two sentence-level defenses.
we can see that the ﬁrst defense based on back-translation paraphrasing still has a limited effecton syntactic, although it can effectively mitigatethe three baseline attacks.
the second defense,which is particularly aimed at syntactic, achievessatisfactory results of defending against syntac-tic eventually.
even so, it causes comparable oreven larger reductions in attack success rates for.
the baselines.
these results demonstrate the greatresistance of syntactic to sentence-level defenses.4.

in table 7, we exhibit some poisoned samplesembedded with the syntactic trigger and thecorresponding original normal samples, wheres(sbar)(,)(np)(vp)(.)
is the selected trig-ger syntactic template.
we can see that the poi-soned samples are quite ﬂuent and natural.
theypossess high invisibility, thus hard to be detectedby either automatic or manual data inspection..6 conclusion and future work.
in this paper, we propose to use the syntactic struc-ture as the trigger of textual backdoor attacks forthe ﬁrst time.
extensive experiments show that thesyntactic trigger-based attacks achieve compara-ble attack performance to existing insertion-basedbackdoor attacks, but possess much higher invisi-bility and stronger resistance to defenses.
we hopethis work can call more attention to backdoor at-tacks in nlp.
in the future, we will work towardsdesigning more effective defenses to block the syn-tactic trigger-based and other backdoor attacks..acknowledgements.

we also thankall the anonymous reviewers for their valuablecomments and suggestions..4it is worth mentioning that both the sentence-level de-fenses markedly impair the clean accuracy (cacc), whichactually renders them not practical..451ethical considerations.
in this paper, we present a more invisible textualbackdoor attack method based on the syntactic trig-ger, mainly aiming to draw attention to backdoorattacks in nlp, a kind of emergent and stealthysecurity threat..there is indeed a possibility that our methodis maliciously used to inject backdoors into somemodels or even practical systems.
but we arguethat it is necessary to study backdoor attacks thor-oughly and openly if we want to defend againstthem, similar to the development of the studies onadversarial attacks and defenses (especially for theﬁeld of computer vision).
as the saying goes, bet-ter the devil you know than the devil you don’tknow.
we should uncover the issues of existingnlp models rather than pretend not to know them.
in terms of countering backdoor attacks, wethink the ﬁrst thing is to make people realize theirrisks.
only based on that, more researchers willwork on designing effective backdoor defensesagainst various backdoor attacks.
more impor-tantly, we need a trusted third-party organization topublish authentic datasets and models with signa-tures, which might fundamentally solve the existingproblems of backdoor attacks.5.
all the datasets we use in this paper are open.
we conduct human evaluations by a reputable dataannotation company, which compensates the anno-tators fairly based on the market price.
