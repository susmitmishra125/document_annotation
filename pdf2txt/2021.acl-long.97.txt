abstract.
reply suggestion models help users processemails and chats faster.
previous work onlystudies english reply suggestion.
instead, wepresent mrs, a multilingual reply suggestiondataset with ten languages.
mrs can be usedto compare two families of models: 1) re-trieval models that select the reply from a ﬁxedset and 2) generation models that producethe reply from scratch.
therefore, mrs com-plements existing cross-lingual generalizationbenchmarks that focus on classiﬁcation andsequence labeling tasks.
we build a gener-ation model and a retrieval model as base-lines for mrs. the two models have differ-ent strengths in the monolingual setting, andthey require different strategies to generalizeacross languages.
mrs is publicly available athttps://github.com/zhangmozhi/mrs..1 multilingual reply suggestion.
automated reply suggestion is a useful feature foremail and chat applications.
given an input mes-sage, the system suggests several replies, and usersmay click on them to save typing time (figure 1).
this feature is available in many applications in-cluding gmail, outlook, linkedin, facebook mes-senger, microsoft teams, and uber..reply suggestion is related to but different fromopen-domain dialog systems or chatbots (adiwar-dana et al., 2020; huang et al., 2020).
while bothare conversational ai tasks (gao et al., 2019), thegoals are different: reply suggestion systems helpthe user quickly reply to a message, while chatbotsaim to continue the conversation and focus moreon multi-turn dialogues..ideally, we want our model to generate replies inany language.
however, reply suggestion modelsrequire large training sets, so previous work mostly.
∗work mostly done as an intern at microsoft research.
†work done at microsoft research..figure 1: an example of reply suggestion system.
usercan click on the suggestions for a quick reply..focuses on english (kannan et al., 2016; hendersonet al., 2017; deb et al., 2019).
to investigate replysuggestion for other languages with possibly lim-ited data, we build a multilingual dataset, dubbedmrs (multilingual reply suggestion).
from pub-licly available reddit threads, we extract message-reply pairs, response sets, and machine-translatedexamples in ten languages (table 1)..one interesting aspect of the reply suggestionproblem is that there are two modeling approaches.
some models follow the retrieval framework andselect the reply from a predetermined responseset (henderson et al., 2017).
others follow thegeneration framework and generate the reply fromscratch (kannan et al., 2016).
the two approacheshave different advantages.
generation models aremore powerful because they are not constrained bythe response set.
in comparison, retrieval modelsare easier to train and runs faster, and a curated re-sponse set guarantees the coherence and the safetyof the model output..the two frameworks make reply suggestion aninteresting task for studying cross-lingual general-ization.
most cross-lingual generalization bench-marks use classiﬁcation and sequence labelingtasks (tjong kim sang, 2002; nivre et al., 2016;strassel and tracey, 2016; conneau et al., 2018;schwenk and li, 2018; clark et al., 2020; hu et al.,2020; lewis et al., 2020b).
in contrast, reply sug-gestion has two formulations that require differ-ent cross-lingual generalization strategies.

for each language, weuse 80% examples for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.
we then create response sets for retrievalmodels.
we also use mt to translate nineteen million english training examples to other languages..learning in generation tasks, the tasks are extrac-tive; i.e., the output often has signiﬁcant overlapwith the input.
these tasks include news title gen-eration, text summarization, and question genera-tion (chi et al., 2020; liang et al., 2020; scialomet al., 2020).
reply suggestion is more challengingbecause the reply often does not overlap with themessage (figure 1), so the model needs to addressdifferent cross-lingual generalization challenges(section 5.2)..we build two baselines for mrs: a retrievalmodel and a generation model.
we ﬁrst comparethe models in english, where we have abundanttraining data and human referees.
we evaluatethe models with both automatic metrics and hu-man judgments.
the two models have differentstrengths.
the generation model has higher wordoverlap scores and is favored by humans on av-erage, but inference is slower, and the output issometimes contradictory or repetitive (holtzmanet al., 2020).
in contrast, the retrieval model isfaster and always produces coherent replies, butthe replies are sometimes too generic or irrelevantdue to the ﬁxed response set..next, we test models in other languages.
wecompare different training settings and investigatetwo cross-lingual generalization methods: initial-izing with pre-trained multilingual models (wuand dredze, 2019; conneau et al., 2020; lianget al., 2020) and training on machine-translateddata (banea et al., 2008).
interestingly, the twomodels prefer different methods: multilingual pre-training works better for the retrieval model, whilethe generation model prefers machine translation.
in summary, we present mrs, a multilingual.
reply suggestion dataset.
we use mrs to providethe ﬁrst systematic comparison between generationand retrieval models for reply suggestion in bothmonolingual and multilingual settings.
mrs is alsoa useful benchmark for future research in replysuggestion and cross-lingual generalization..the rest of the paper is organized as follows.
section 2 describes the data collection process formrs. section 3 introduces task formulations, exper-iment settings, and evaluation metrics.
section 4describes the baseline generation and retrieval mod-els.
section 5 presents our experiment results.
sec-tion 6 discusses how mrs can help future research..2 dataset construction.
to study reply suggestion in multiple languages,we build mrs, a dataset with message-reply pairsbased on reddit comments.
the dataset is availableat https://github.com/zhangmozhi/mrs..we download reddit comments between january2010 and december 2019 from the pushshift red-dit dataset (baumgartner et al., 2020).1 we extractmessage-reply pairs from each thread by consider-ing the parent comment as an input message andthe response to the comment as the reference reply.
we remove comments starting with [removed] or[deleted], which are deleted messages.
we alsoskip comments with a rating of less than one, sincethey are likely to contain inappropriate content..after extracting examples, we identify their lan-guages with fasttext language detector (joulinet al., 2016).
for each example, we run the model.

comments.
1208on the concatenation of the message and the reply.
we discard low-conﬁdence examples where noneof the languages has a score higher than 0.7. forthe remaining examples, we use the highest-scoringlabel as the language..we only use english data from 2018 becauseenglish data is abundant on reddit.
non-englishexamples are much more scarce, so we use datafrom the last ten years.
we select the top ten lan-guages with at least 100k examples.
we createthree splits for each language: 80% examples fortraining, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.
table 1 shows some dataset statistics.
mrs isheavily biased towards english.
we have morethan 48 million english examples, but fewer thanone million examples for half of the languages.
this gap reﬂects a practical challenge for replysuggestion—we do not have enough data for mostlanguages in the world.
nevertheless, we canuse mrs to test models in different multilingualsettings, including cross-lingual transfer learning,where we build non-english reply suggestion mod-els from english data (section 3.2)..we also build response sets and ﬁlter out toxic.
examples.
we describe these steps next..2.1 response set.
we build a response set of 30k to 50k most fre-quent replies for each language, which are used inthe retrieval model.
we want the response set tocover generic responses, so we select replies thatappear at least twenty times in the dataset.
thissimple criterion works well for english, but the setis too small for other languages.
for non-englishlanguages, we augment the response set by trans-lating the english response set to other languageswith microsoft translator.
the non-english re-sponse set is sometimes smaller than the englishset, because different english responses may havethe same translation..2.2 filtering toxic examples.
exchanges on reddit are sometimes uncivil, inap-propriate, or even abusive (massanari, 2017; mo-han et al., 2017).
we try to ﬁlter out toxic contents,as they are not desirable for reply suggestion sys-tems..we use two toxicity detection models.
first, weuse an in-house multilingual model.
the model isinitialized with multilingual bert (devlin et al.,2019, mbert) and ﬁne-tuned on a mixture of pro-prietary and public datasets with toxic and offen-.
sive language labels.
the model outputs a scorefrom zero to one, with a higher score correspond-ing to a higher level of toxicity.
second, we useperspective api2, a publicly available model.
per-spective api has limited free access (one query persecond), so we only use the api on the englishvalidation, test, and response set.
for other lan-guages, we rely on our in-house model.
we ﬁltermessage-reply pairs if it has greater than 0.9 scoreaccording to the in-house model, or greater than0.5 score according to perspective api (gehmanet al., 2020).
about one percent of examples areﬁltered.
after ﬁltering the data, we manually val-idate three hundred random examples and do notﬁnd any toxic examples, which conﬁrms that ourﬁlter method have a high recall..while we hope the ﬁltered dataset leads to betterreply suggestion models, existing ﬁltering meth-ods are not perfect and can introduce other bi-ases (dixon et al., 2018; sap et al., 2019; hutchin-son et al., 2020).
therefore, models trained onall mrs data may still have undesirable behavior.
mrs is intended to be used as a benchmark fortesting cross-lingual generalization of generationand retrieval models.
the dataset should not bedirectly used in production systems.
to use thedataset in practice, additional work is required toaddress other possible biases and toxic or inappro-priate content that may exist in the data..3 experiment settings.
after presenting the dataset, we explain how weuse mrs to compare reply suggestion models.
wedescribe the two frameworks for reply suggestion,our experiment settings, and evaluation metrics..3.1 task formulation.
in reply suggestion, the input is a message x, andthe output is one or more suggested replies y. inpractice, reply suggestion systems can choose tonot suggest any replies.
this decision is usuallymade by a separate trigger model (kannan et al.,2016).
in this paper, we focus on reply generation,so we assume that the models always need to sug-gest a ﬁxed number of replies.
reply suggestioncan be formulated as either a retrieval problem ora generation problem..retrieval model.
a retrieval model selects thereply y from a ﬁxed response set y (section 2.1)..2https://www.perspectiveapi.com.
1209given an input message x, the model computesa relevance score θxy for each candidate replyy ∈ y. the model then selects the highest-scoring replies as suggestions; e.g., the top-1 replyis arg maxy∈y θxy..generation model.
a generation model gener-ates the reply y from scratch.
generation mod-els usually follow the sequence-to-sequence frame-work (sutskever et al., 2014, seq2seq), whichgenerates y token by token.
given an input mes-sage x = (x1, x2, · · · , xn) of n tokens, a seq2seqmodel estimates the probability of a reply y =(y1, y2, · · · , ym) of m tokens as following:.
p(y | x) =.
p(yi | x, y<i)..(1).
m(cid:89).
i=1.
the model computes probability for the next tokenp(yi | x, y<i) based on the input x and the ﬁrst (i −1) tokens of the output y. the model is trained tomaximize the probability of reference replies in thetraining set.
at test time, we ﬁnd the top repliesthat approximately maximize (1) with beam search.
the two models have different strengths.
thegeneration model is more ﬂexible, but the retrievalmodel is faster (henderson et al., 2017), and theoutput can be controlled by curating the responseset (kannan et al., 2016)..we compare a retrieval model and a generationmodel as baselines for mrs. to our knowledge, weare the ﬁrst to systematically compare the two mod-els in both monolingual and multilingual settings.
we explain our training settings and metrics next..3.2 training settings.
for each language in mrs, we train and comparemodels in four settings.
future work can experi-ment with other settings (discussed in section 6)..monolingual.
here, we simply train and testmodels in a single language.
this setting simu-lates the scenario where we have adequate trainingdata for the target language.
previous reply sug-gestion models were only studied in the englishmonolingual setting..zero-shot.
next, we train models in a zero-shotcross-lingual setting.
we train the model on theenglish training set and use the model on the testset for another language.
this setting simulatesthe scenario where we want to build models for alow-resource language using our large english set..to generalize across languages, we initialize themodels with pre-trained multilingual models (de-tails in section 4).
these models work well in othertasks (wu and dredze, 2019; liang et al., 2020).
we test if they also work for reply suggestion, asdifferent tasks often prefer different multilingualrepresentations (zhang et al., 2020b)..machine translation (mt).
another strategyfor cross-lingual generalization is to train onmachine-translated data (banea et al., 2008).
wetrain models on nineteen million english trainingexamples machine-translated to the target languagewith microsoft translator.
we compare against thezero-shot setting to compare the two cross-lingualgeneralization strategies..multilingual.
finally, we build a multilingualmodel by jointly training on the ﬁve languageswith the most training data: english, spanish, ger-man, portuguese, and french.
we oversample non-english training data to have the same number oftraining examples data across all languages (john-son et al., 2017).
we make two comparisons: 1) forthe ﬁve training languages, we compare against themonolingual setting to test whether ﬁtting multi-ple languages in a single model hurts performance;and 2) for other languages, we compare against thezero-shot setting to check if adding more traininglanguages helps cross-lingual generalization..3.3 evaluation metrics.
the goal of reply suggestion is to save user typingtime, so the ideal metrics are click-through rate(ctr), how often the user chooses a suggested re-ply, and time reduction, how much time is saved byclicking the suggestion instead of typing.
however,these metrics require deploying the model to test onreal users, which is not feasible at full-scale whilewriting this paper.
instead, we focus on automatedofﬂine metrics that can guide research and modeldevelopment before deploying production systems.
speciﬁcally, we evaluate models using a test set ofmessage-reply pairs..to identify a good metric, we compare severalmetrics in a pilot study by deploying an englishsystem.
we collect millions of user interactions andmeasure pearson’s correlation between ctr andautomated ofﬂine metrics.
the next paragraph liststhe metrics.
based on the study, we recommendweighted rouge f1 ensemble (rouge in tables),which has the highest correlation with ctr..1210for the retrieval model, we follow previous workand consider mean reciprocal rank (kannan et al.,2016, mrr) and precision at one (henderson et al.,2017).
these metrics test if the model can retrievethe reference response from a random set of re-sponses.
alternatively, we compute mrr and pre-cision on a subset of examples where the referencereply is in the response set so that we can directlymeasure the rank of the reference response in theresponse set.
this set also allows us to computemrr for individual responses, so we can computemacro-mrr, the average mrr over each responsein the set.
higher macro-mrr can indicate di-versity but has a worse correlation than comput-ing mrr over the entire test set.
for the genera-tion model, we consider model perplexity (adiwar-dana et al., 2020).
finally, we consider two wordoverlap scores, bleu (papineni et al., 2002) androuge (lin, 2004), which can be used for bothretrieval and generation models..our pilot study shows that rouge has the bestcorrelation.
however, individual rouge f1 scores(rouge-1/2/3) are sensitive to small changes insequence lengths (more so because our responsesare generally short).
therefore, we use a weightedaverage of the three scores:.
rouge-16.
+.
rouge-23.
+.
rouge-32.
..(2).
this weighted score leads to the highest correlationwith ctr.
intuitively, the weights balance the dif-ferences in the average magnitude of each metricand thus reduce variance on short responses..popular reply suggestion systems (such as gmailand outlook) suggest three replies for each mes-sage, while the user only selects one.
to simulatethis setting, we predict three replies for each mes-sage.
for the retrieval model, we use the threehighest-scoring replies from the response set.
forthe generation model, we use top-three results frombeam search.
out of the three replies, we only usethe reply with the highest rouge compared to thereference reply when computing the ﬁnal metrics;i.e., the model only has to provide one “correct”reply to have a full score..we compare models primarily with rouge,since the metric has the best correlation in the pi-lot study.
nevertheless, word overlap scores haveknown limitations (liu et al., 2016), as there aredifferent ways to reply to a message.
we encour-age future research to investigate other metrics tounderstand different aspects of the model..as examples, we also report two diversity scores:the proportion of distinct unigrams (dist-1) andbigrams (dist-2) in the generated replies (li et al.,2016).
while rouge measures the relevance of thereplies, higher diversity can also increase ctr (debet al., 2019).
we can improve the diversity of thethree replies with diversity-promoting decoding (liet al., 2016; vijayakumar et al., 2018; zhang et al.,2018) or latent variable models (deb et al., 2019),but we leave this direction to future work..for our english monolingual experiments, wealso complement automatic metrics with humanjudgments (human in figure 2).
for each ex-ample, we display the input message and sets ofthree suggested replies from both generation andretrieval models to three human annotators (crowdworkers).
we then ask the annotators to select theset with more responses that they prefer to send asa reply.
we leave evaluations for other languagesto future work due to resource limitations..4 baseline models.
this section introduces the two baseline models: aretrieval model and a generation model..4.1 retrieval model.
for the retrieval model, we use the architecturefrom henderson et al.
(2017), except we replacethe feedforward network encoders with transform-ers (vaswani et al., 2017).
given an input messagex and candidate reply y, two transformer encodersφx and φy map the message and the reply to twovectors φx(x) and φy(y).
the relevance scoreθxy between the message x and the reply y is thedot product of the two vectors:.
θxy = φx(x)(cid:62)φy(y)..(3).
henderson et al.
(2017) also adds a language modelscore to encourage more frequent replies.
we donot use language model score for simplicity..we train the model with the symmetric lossfrom deb et al.
(2019).
suppose the batch sizeis n. for a batch of training messages {xi}ni=1 andcorresponding replies {yi}n.j=1, we maximize:.
n(cid:88).
i=1.
(cid:80)n.j=1.
eθxiyieθxiyj + eθxj yi.
(cid:16).
(cid:17).
..(4).
− eθxiyi.
in a regular softmax loss, the denominator onlysums over one variable.
the denominator in the.
1211figure 2: generation vs.retrieval model on english.
both automatic metrics and human referees prefer thegeneration model.
the human score measures how often the human referee prefers the replies from one modelover another.
the human score does not add up to one, because the referee can choose tie..i think i want to play it so it better be available for ps4..message:generation: i’m sure it’ll be available for ps4 as well.
retrieval:.
i’d play it..very nice!
what model is this?
obviously new softail/dyna, but which?.
message:generation: it’s a softail, but i’m not sure what model it is.
retrieval:.
delta..interesting proposal.
especially since they just announced mixon is going to have a scope..message:generation: i’m pretty sure it’s going to have a scope, but i don’t think it’s going to have a scope.
retrieval: where did they say that?.
oh the stickers!
i envy you, lush didn’t sent me any with my body lotion order..message:generation: i’m so sorry.
i’m so sorry.
i’m so sorry.
retrieval: what did you order?.
table 2: example replies suggested by english models.
in the top two examples, the generation model producesmore relevant replies than the retrieval model.
in the bottom two examples, the generation model produces contra-dictory and repetitive replies, while the retrieval model selects appropriate replies from the response set..symmetric loss sum over both variables to encour-age bidirectional compatibility: the message shouldbe predictive of the reply, and the reply should bepredictive of the message.
this encourages themodel to select responses speciﬁc to the message,similar to the maximum mutual information objec-tive from li et al.
(2016)..the two encoders φx and φy are initialized withmbert (devlin et al., 2019), a transformer with110 million parameters pre-trained on multilingualcorpora.
initializing with mbert allows the modelto generalize across languages (wu and dredze,2019).
in appendix a, we experiment with anotherpre-trained multilingual transformer, xlm-r (con-neau et al., 2020).
we use the “base” version with270 million parameters..4.2 generation model.
for the generation model, we follow the seq2seqarchitecture (section 3.1).
we use a transformerencoder to read the input x, and another trans-former decoder to estimate p(yi | x, y<i) in (1)..we cannot initialize the generation model withmbert or xlm-r, because the model also has adecoder.
instead, we use unicoder-xdae (lianget al., 2020), a pre-trained multilingual seq2seqmodel, which can generalize across languages inextractive generation tasks such as news title gener-ation and question generation.
we test if unicoder-xdae also generalizes in the more challenging re-ply suggestion task.
there are other generationmodels we can use, which we discuss as futurework in section 6..4.3 training details.
we train the retrieval model using adam opti-mizer (kingma and ba, 2015) with 1e-6 learningrate, default β, and 256 batch size.
for monolin-gual and zero-shot settings, we use twenty epochsfor english and ﬁfty epochs for other languages.
we use ten epochs for mt and multilingual set-tings.
the ﬁrst 1% training steps are warmup steps.
during training, we freeze the embedding layersand the bottom two transformer layers of both en-.

the settings are in section 3.2.gray cells indicate when the model is trained on the target language training set.
white cells indicate cross-lingual settings where the target language training set is not used for training.
for each language, we boldfacethe best rouge scores in cross-lingual settings (white cells).
the zero-shot setting has better rouge scores thanusing mt data for most languages, and the results are sometimes close to monolingual training, conﬁrming theeffectiveness of mbert.
multilingual training hurts training languages (gray cells compared to monolingual) butsometimes improves cross-lingual generalization (white cells compared to zero-shot)..coders, which preserves multilingual knowledgefrom the pre-trained model and improves cross-lingual transfer learning (wu and dredze, 2019).
all hyperparameters are manually tuned on the en-glish validation set..we use almost the same hyperparameters asliang et al.
(2020) to train generation models.
speciﬁcally, we use adam optimizer with 1e-5initial learning rate, default β, and 1024 batch size.
for the monolingual and zero-shot setting, we usefour epochs for english and 5000 steps for otherlanguages (equivalent to two to nine epochs de-pending on the language).
we use one epoch forthe mt setting and 40,000 steps for the multilingualsetting.
the ﬁrst 20% training steps are warmupsteps.
we freeze the embedding layer during train-ing for faster training..all models are trained with eight tesla v100gpu.
it takes about an hour to train the generationmodel for 1000 steps (covering about one millionexamples).
for the retrieval model, an epoch on theenglish training set (about 48 million examples)takes about seven hours..5 results and discussion.
we experiment with the two baselines from sec-tion 4 on mrs. we ﬁrst compare the models inenglish, where we have enough training data andhuman referees.
we then build models for other.
languages and compare training settings listed insection 3.2..5.1 results on english.
figure 2 compares the generation and retrieval mod-els in the english monolingual setting.
generationmodel not only has higher relevance (rouge) scorebut also can generate more diverse replies (higherdist scores).
for english, we also ask three humanreferees to compare the model outputs on a subsetof 500 test examples.
again, the referees preferthe generation model more often than the retrievalmodel (figure 2)..we look at some generated responses to under-stand the models qualitatively.
in the top two ex-amples in table 2, the generation model producesreplies highly speciﬁc to the input message.
incontrast, the retrieval model fails to ﬁnd a relevantreply, because the response set does not cover thesetopics.
this explains why the generation model hasmuch higher rouge and distinct n-gram scoresthan the retrieval model..however, the expressiveness comes at the costof a lack of control over the generated replies.
thegeneration model sometimes produces incoherentreplies that are repetitive and/or contradictory, asshown in the bottom two examples of table 2. forthe retrieval model, we can easily avoid these prob-lems by curating the ﬁxed response set.
thesedegenerative behaviors are observed in other text.

the settings are in section 3.2. gray cells indicate when the model istrained on the target language training set.
white cells indicate cross-lingual settings where the target languagetraining set is not used for training.
for each language, we boldface the best rouge scores in cross-lingual settings(white cells).
despite initializing with unicoder-xdae (liang et al., 2020), the model fails to generalize acrosslanguages in zero-shot settings.
the table does not include zero-shot results because the model only producesenglish replies and thus has near-zero rouge.
multilingual training hurts training languages (gray cells comparedto monolingual), but the model can now generalize to unseen languages.
training on mt data is the best cross-lingual generalization method for the generation model..generation tasks and can be mitigated by chang-ing training and decoding objectives (holtzmanet al., 2020; welleck et al., 2020).
we leave thesedirections for future research..5.2 results on other languages.
after comparing english models, we experiment onother languages using the settings from section 3.2..retrieval model.
table 3 shows results for theretrieval model when initialized with mbert.
theretrieval model can generalize fairly well acrosslanguages, as the rouge in the zero-shot settingis often close to the monolingual setting.
this re-sult conﬁrms that initializing with mbert is aneffective strategy for cross-lingual generalization.
training on mt data is usually worse than trainingin the zero-shot setting.
this is possible becausethe mt system may create artifacts that do not ap-pear in organic data (artetxe et al., 2020).
for themultilingual model, the training language rougescores are lower than monolingual training (graycells in table 3).
however, multilingual trainingsometimes leads to better rouge on unseen lan-guages compared to transferring from only english(zero-shot).
previous work observes similar re-sults on other tasks, where multilingual traininghurts training languages but helps generalizationto unseen languages (johnson et al., 2017; con-.
neau et al., 2020; wang et al., 2020).
finally, ap-pendix a shows similar results when initializingwith xlm-r (conneau et al., 2020)..generation model.
table 4 shows results for thegeneration model.
in the monolingual setting, thegeneration model has higher scores than the re-trieval model on most languages, consistent withthe english result (figure 2).
however, unlikethe retrieval model, the generation model fails togeneralize across languages in the zero-shot set-ting, despite using unicoder-xdae for initializa-tion.
we do not show zero-shot results in table 4,because rouge are close to zero for non-englishlanguages.
after training on english data, themodel always produces english replies, regardlessof the input language; i.e., the generation model“forgets” multilingual knowledge acquired duringpre-training (kirkpatrick et al., 2017).
this resultis surprising because unicoder-xdae works in thezero-shot setting for other generation tasks (lianget al., 2020), which suggests that reply suggestionposes unique challenges for cross-lingual transferlearning.
interestingly, the multilingual model cangeneralize to unseen languages; perhaps trainingon multiple languages regularizes the model to pro-duce replies in the input language.
overall, the bestmethod to generalize the generation model acrosslanguages is to use machine-translated data..12146 future work.
mrs opens up opportunities for future research.
our experiments use four training settings (sec-tion 3.2), but there are many other settings to ex-plore.
for example, we can use other combinationsof training languages, which may work better forsome target languages (ammar et al., 2016; cot-terell and heigold, 2017; ahmad et al., 2019; linet al., 2019; zhang et al., 2020a).
we are also inter-ested in training on both organic data and mt data;i.e., mixing the zero-shot and mt setting..we can also compare other models on mrs. forthe english monolingual setting, we can initializethe generation model with state-of-the-art languagemodels (radford et al., 2019; brown et al., 2020;zhang et al., 2020c).
for cross-lingual settings,we can initialize the generation model with sev-eral recent pre-trained multilingual seq2seq mod-els (chi et al., 2020, 2021; liu et al., 2020; tranet al., 2020; lewis et al., 2020a; xue et al., 2020).
for retrieval models, we can experiment with othermultilingual encoders that use different pre-trainingtasks (artetxe and schwenk, 2019; chidambaramet al., 2019; reimers and gurevych, 2020; fenget al., 2020)..another idea is to combine the two models.
given an input message, we ﬁrst use a generationmodel to create a set of candidate replies.
we thenuse a retrieval model to compute relevance scoresand rerank these candidates.
reranking the outputof a generation model helps other natural languageprocessing tasks (shen et al., 2004; collins andkoo, 2005; ge and mooney, 2006), and previouswork uses a similar idea for chatbots (qiu et al.,2017)..our experiment shows that reply suggestionposes unique challenges for cross-lingual general-ization, especially for the generation model.
futurework can study methods to improve cross-lingualgeneralization methods.
some examples includeapplying adversarial learning (chen et al., 2018,2019; huang et al., 2019), using adapters (pfeifferet al., 2020), adaptive transfer (xia et al., 2021),mixing pre-training and ﬁne-tuning (phang et al.,2020), and bringing a human in the loop (yuanet al., 2020)..7 conclusion.
we present mrs, a multilingual dataset for replysuggestion.
we compare a generation and a re-trieval baseline on mrs. the two models have dif-.
ferent strengths in the english monolingual settingand require different strategies to transfer acrosslanguages.
mrs provides a benchmark for futureresearch in both reply suggestion and cross-lingualtransfer learning..ethical considerations.
data collection.
no human annotators are in-volved while creating mrs. the examples andresponse sets of mrs come from publicly avail-able reddit dumps from pushshift, which are usedin more than a hundred peer-reviewed publica-tions (baumgartner et al., 2020)..privacy.
examples in mrs do not have the user-name and are from publicly available data.
there-fore, we do not anticipate any privacy issues.
in thepilot study (section 3.3), we measure the correla-tion of user ctr with different evaluation metrics.
to protect user privacy, we only collect aggregatedstatistics (ctr) and use no other information..potential biased and toxic content.
despiteour best effort to ﬁlter toxic contents (section 2.2),the dataset may not be perfectly cleansed andmay have other biases that are typical in open fo-rums (massanari, 2017; mohan et al., 2017).
usersshould be aware of these issues.
we will continueto improve the quality of the dataset..intended use of mrs. because of the possi-ble biases and inappropriateness in the data, mrsshould not be directly used to build productionsystems (as mentioned in section 2.2).
the mainuse of mrs is to test cross-lingual generalizationfor text retrieval and generation models, and re-searchers should be aware of possible ethical issuesof reddit data before using mrs..acknowledgement.
