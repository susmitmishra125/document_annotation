abstract.
while online conversations can cover a vastamount of information in many different for-mats, abstractive text summarization has pri-marily focused on modeling solely news ar-ticles.
this research gap is due, in part, tothe lack of standardized datasets for summa-rizing online discussions.
to address this gap,we design annotation protocols motivated byan issues–viewpoints–assertions framework tocrowdsource four new datasets on diverse on-line conversation forms of news comments,discussion forums, community question an-swering forums, and email threads.
we bench-mark state-of-the-art models on our datasetsand analyze characteristics associated with thedata.
to create a comprehensive benchmark,we also evaluate these models on widely-usedconversation summarization datasets to estab-lish strong baselines in this domain.
fur-thermore, we incorporate argument miningthrough graph construction to directly modelthe issues, viewpoints, and assertions presentin a conversation and ﬁlter noisy input, show-ing comparable or improved results accordingto automatic and human evaluations..1.introduction.
automatic text summarization is the process ofoutputting the most salient parts of an input in aconcise and readable form.
recent work in sum-marization has made signiﬁcant progress due tointroducing large-scale datasets such as the cnn-dailymail dataset (nallapati et al., 2016) and thenew york times dataset (sandhaus, 2008).
further-more, the use of large self-supervised pretrainedmodels such as bart (lewis et al., 2020) andpegasus (zhang et al., 2019) has achieved state-of-the-art performance across summarization tasksand strong performance in zero and few-shot set-tings (fabbri et al., 2020a).
however, less workhas focused on summarizing online conversations..headline: superbowlsnippet: whether you’re a football fan or not, what doyou like about super bowl sunday?
comment: ...in my opinion i think the falcons willstomp the patriots.
i think tom brady will choke the superbowl.
...comment: i am big arizona cardinals fan so when theydidn’t even make the playoffs i was upset.
...comment: i’m not a very big football fan at all.
sowhen it comes to superbowl sunday, i’m in it for thecommercials and the half time show.
...comment: i am not exactly a football fan, but i enjoywatching the super bowl.......summary:several commenters list their favorite things about thesuper bowl, including half-time shows, the funny com-mercials, the puppy bowl, eating food, and spending timewith family.
a couple of commenters admit to not beingfootball fans but still enjoying the super bowl.
some com-menters discuss whether they thought the falcons or thepatriots were going to win, while others list teams theywish were in the game..table 1: example summary of comments from a newyork times article discussing people’s favorite parts ofthe super bowl.
the summary is an analysis of thecomments and quantiﬁes the viewpoints present..unlike documents, articles, and scientiﬁc papers,which contain speciﬁc linguistic structures and con-ventions such as topic sentences and abstracts, con-versational text scatters main points across multipleutterances and between numerous writers.
as aresult, the text summarization task in the conver-sational data domain offers a challenging researchﬁeld to test newly-developed models (chen andyang, 2020)..recently, gliwa et al.
(2019a) introduced adataset for chat-dialogue conversation summariza-tion consisting of 16k examples, the ﬁrst large-scale dataset of its kind.
previous work in con-versation summarization was limited by the dataavailable and focused primarily on meeting sum-marization, such as the ami (kraaij et al., 2005)and icsi (janin et al., 2003) datasets.
the datasets.
proceedingsofthe59thannualmeetingoftheassociationforcomputationallinguisticsandthe11thinternationaljointconferenceonnaturallanguageprocessing,pages6866–6880august1–6,2021.©2021associationforcomputationallinguistics6866used in recent conversation papers are often not uni-form, ranging from visual dialogue data (goo andchen, 2018a) to customer-service dialogues (yuanand yu, 2019), not initially intended for summa-rization.
the availability of benchmark datasets forcomparing methods has limited work in other con-versation summarization domains and thus likelyinhibited progress (kryscinski et al., 2019; fabbriet al., 2020b)..we aim to address this research gap by crowd-sourcing a suite of four datasets, which we callconvosumm, that can evaluate a model’s perfor-mance on a broad spectrum of conversation data.
indetermining the domains of data to collect, we usethe general deﬁnition of conversation as “any dis-course produced by more than one person” (ford,1991).
we identify several key categories of datafor which standard human-created developmentand testing datasets do not exist, namely (1) newsarticle comments, (2) discussion forums and debate,(3) community question answering, and (4) emailthreads.
we design annotation protocols motivatedby work in quantifying viewpoints present in newscomment data (barker and gaizauskas, 2016a) tocrowdsource 250 development and 250 test exam-ples for each of the above domains.
we provide anexample of comments to a new york times newsarticle, and our crowdsourced summary in table 1..in addition to introducing manually-curateddatasets for conversation summarization, we alsoaim to unify previous work in conversation summa-rization.
namely, we benchmark a state-of-the-artabstractive model on several conversation datasets:dialogue summarization from samsum (gliwaet al., 2019b), heuristic-generated community ques-tion answering from cqasumm (chowdhury andchakraborty, 2018), meeting summarization datafrom ami and icsi, and smaller test sets in thenews comments, discussion forum, and email do-mains.
we believe that such benchmarking willfacilitate a more straightforward comparison of con-versation summarization models across domains..to unify modeling across these conversationaldomains, we propose to use recent work in end-to-end argument mining (lenz et al., 2020; stab andgurevych, 2014; chakrabarty et al., 2019) to instan-tiate the theoretical graph framework which moti-vated our annotation protocol, proposed by barkerand gaizauskas (2016a) for conversation summa-rization.
this protocol is employed to both identifyand use the “issues–viewpoints–assertions” argu-.
ment structure (discussed in related work) for sum-marizing news comments.
we construct this argu-ment graph using entailment relations, linearize thegraph, train a graph-to-text model (ribeiro et al.,2020), and experiment with argument mining as away to reduce noise in long-text input..our contributions are the following:.
(1) wecrowdsource datasets for four domains of conver-sational data and analyze the characteristics of ourproposed datasets; (2) we benchmark state-of-the-art models on these datasets as well as previouswidely-used conversation summarization datasetsto provide a clear baseline for future work; and(3) we apply argument mining to model the struc-ture of our conversational data better as well asreduce noise in long-text input, showing compa-rable or improved results in both automatic andhuman evaluations.1.
2 related work.
modeling conversation summarization earlyapproaches to conversation summarization con-sisted of feature engineering (shasha xie et al.,2008), template selection methods (oya et al.,2014), and statistical machine learning approaches(galley, 2006; wang and cardie, 2013).
more re-cent modeling approaches for dialogue summariza-tion have attempted to take advantage of conver-sation structures found within the data through di-alogue act classiﬁcation (goo and chen, 2018b),discourse labeling (ganesh and dingliwal, 2019),topic segmentation (liu et al., 2019c), and key-point analysis (liu et al., 2019a).
chen andyang (2020) utilize multiple conversational struc-tures from different perspectives in its sequence-to-sequence model.
however, such approaches focusexclusively on dialogue summarization, and it isnot trivial to extend such methods to longer con-versations with many more participants.
we thusintroduce a method to model the structure of thediscourse over the many-party conversation..several existing works have focused on con-ceptualizing conversation structure for summa-rization and how to present this structure to end-users.
barker et al.
(2016a) propose a conversationoverview summary that aims to capture the keyargumentative content of a reader comment con-versation.
misra et al.
(2017) use summarization.
1for reproducibility of our ﬁndings, we will make our dataand code publicly available at https://github.com/yale-lily/convosumm..6867as a means of probing online debates to discovercentral propositions, which they cluster to identifyargument facets.
barker and gaizauskas (2016b)identify three key components of conversational di-alogue: issues (that individuals discuss), viewpoints(that they hold about these issues), and assertions(that they make to support their viewpoints).
webuild on this framework and advances in argumentmining for end-to-end training for summarization..argument mining work in argument mining(stab and gurevych, 2014) has aimed to iden-tify these argumentative units and classify theminto claims, premises, and major claims, or claimsdescribing the key concept in a text.
more re-cently, chakrabarty et al.
(2019) propose to ﬁne-tune bert (devlin et al., 2019) for identifying ar-gumentative units and relationships between themwithin a text and across texts.
lenz et al.
(2020) arethe ﬁrst to propose an end-to-end approach for con-structing an argument graph (stede et al., 2016),a structured representation of claims and premisesin an argumentative text; the graph is built by con-necting claim and premise argumentative discourseunits.
we build on this framework for modelingdiscourse in conversational data..few-shot summarization as the datasets weintroduce are not on a scale with larger datasets,we focus on few-shot and domain transfer summa-rization techniques.
wang et al.
(2019) examine do-main adaptation in extractive summarization, whilehua and wang (2017) examine domain adaptationbetween opinion and news summarization.
withinunsupervised abstractive summarization, severalapproaches have made use of variational autoen-coders (baziotis et al., 2019; chu and liu, 2019;braˇzinskas et al., 2020) and pretrained languagemodels (zhou and rush, 2019; laban et al., 2020).
recent work in abstractive (zhang et al., 2019;fabbri et al., 2020a) and extractive-compressivesummarization (desai et al., 2020) has shown thepower of pretrained models for a few-shot transfer.
the quality of models trained on several hundredexamples in these papers is comparable to that ofmodels trained on the equivalent full datasets.
thus,we believe that introducing curated validation andtesting datasets consisting of a few hundred exam-ples is a valuable contribution within the currentparadigm, which was conﬁrmed by the poor perfor-mance of models transferred from other domainscompared to that trained on this validation data..3 convosumm.
in this section, we introduce our dataset selection,our annotation protocol, and the characteristics ofour crowdsourced dataset..data selection for the news comments subdo-main, we use the nyt comments dataset, whichconsists of 2 million comments made on 9,000new york times articles published between 2017and 2018. it is publicly available and has beenused in work for news-comment relevance mod-eling (kolhatkar and taboada, 2017); it also con-tains metadata that may be of use in summarizationmodeling.
for the discussion forums and debatesubdomain, we select reddit data from coarsedis-course (zhang et al., 2017), which contains anno-tations about the discourse structure of the threads.
for the community question answering subdomain,we use stackexchange (stack), which provides ac-cess to all forums and has been used in modelingfor answer relevance and question deduplication(hoogeveen et al., 2015).
we chose stackexchangeover the commonly-used yahoo!
answers data dueto licensing reasons.
for the email threads subdo-main, we use the publicly-available w3c corpus(craswell et al., 2005).
previous work also madeuse of this dataset for email summarization (ulrichet al., 2008) but provided only a small sample of 40email threads, for which we provide transfer testingresults..we generally follow the guidance of tomasoniand huang (2010), from summarizing communityquestion answering forums, for determining whichsubsets of data to select from the above datasets.
we remove an example if (1) there were less thanﬁve posts (four in the case of email threads; “post”refers to any answer, comment, or email); (2) thelongest post was over 400 words; (3) the sum ofall post lengths was outside of [100, 1400] words(although we extended this maximum length fornyt comments); or (4) the average length of theposts was outside of the [50, 300] words interval.
for stack data, we ﬁrst ﬁltered answers which re-ceived a negative community rating, as deﬁned bythe number of user upvotes minus the number ofuser downvotes.
while real-world settings maycontain much longer threads, we later show thatthis setting is already challenging..annotation protocol we designed annotationinstructions for crowdsourced workers to writethe fourabstractive summaries for each of.

(2020a): inter-document simi-larity (father from zero is less similarity), redundancy(father from zero is less overall redundancy of semanticunits), and start/middle/end layout bias..datasets, motivated by work in summarizing view-points present in online conversation (barker andgaizauskas, 2016a).
we present the crowdsourceworkers with the data threads, along with any avail-able metadata.
for nyt, we presented the workerswith the article headline, keywords, and, rather thanproviding the entire article as context, an extrac-tive bert-based summary (miller, 2019) of thearticle.
we use a bert summary to give the anno-tators an idea of the topic of the article.
we avoidedhaving annotators read the entire article since thefocus of their summaries was solely the contentof the comments as per the annotation protocols,and reading the entire article could end up intro-ducing information in the summaries that was notnecessarily representative of the comments’ mainpoints.
we found that these summaries were use-ful in initial in-house annotations, and allowed usto better understand the context of the commentsbeing summarized.
for reddit and stack, questiontags and information about the subforum were pro-vided; the stack data includes both answers andanswer comments.
reddit data was ﬁltered simplyon word limits due to the unavailability of up/downvotes from the coarse discourse data.
stack dataincludes the prompt/title as well.
whenever pos-sible, we included username information and thescores of all comments, posts, and answers..although the instructions differed slightly withthe speciﬁc nuances of each dataset, they had stan-dard overall rules: (1) summaries should be an anal-.
ysis of the given input rather than another responseor utterance; (2) summaries should be abstractive,i.e., annotators were required to paraphrase andcould not repeat more than ﬁve words in a row fromthe source; and (3) summary lengths should contain[40, 90] tokens.
following the issues–viewpoints–assertions framework presented in barker andgaizauskas (2016b), we also instructed annotatorsthat summaries should summarize all viewpoints inthe input and should try to include speciﬁc detailsfrom assertions and anecdotes (unless this madethe summary too lengthy).
summarizing based onsimilar viewpoints is analogous to clustering thensummarizing, similar to the comment label group-ing procedure before summarization in barker et al.
(2016b).
to help with this, we recommended word-ing such as “most commenters suggest that...” and“some commenters think that...” to group responseswith similar viewpoints..however, the email dataset was unique amongthe selected datasets given that it contained moreback-and-forth dialogue than clusters of view-points, and thus identifying the speakers was essen-tial to creating summaries that still retained mean-ing from the original email dialogue.
since theemail threads contained fewer individual speakersthan the other datasets, this sort of summarizationremained feasible.
thus, for this dataset, annota-tors were instructed to specify the speakers whensummarizing the conversation..quality-controlled crowdsourcing we crowd-sourced our data using amazon mechanical turk.
we required that our workers be native englishspeakers and pass a qualifying exam for each do-main to be summarized.
we worked with a selectgroup of about 15 workers who formed a com-munity of high-quality annotators.
example sum-maries were provided to the workers.
the workerssubmitted the qualifying exam, and then one ofthe authors of this paper provided feedback.
if theworker was not sure of the quality of the summaries.
6869written, at any point, they could enlist the input ofone of the authors..additionally, after the workers wrote all sum-maries, we manually reviewed every summary andmade corrections to grammar, wording, and overallstructure.
summaries we could not ﬁx ourselves,either because they were poorly written or did notfollow the annotation protocols, were ﬂagged to bere-written.
they were then sent to our approvedgroup of workers to be re-written, excluding anyworkers who had written a ﬂagged summary.
whiledata crowdsourced from non-experts may containnoise (gillick and liu, 2010), we believe that oursetup of working closely with a small group ofworkers, providing feedback to individual work-ers, and manually reviewing all ﬁnal summariesmitigates these issues..dataset statistics we provide statistics in ta-ble 2. the percentage of novel n-grams in oursummaries is higher than that of the very ab-stractive xsum dataset (narayan et al., 2018)(35.76/83.45/95.50 -% novel uni/bi/tri-grams).
this level of abstraction is likely due to the in-structions to perform abstractive summarizationand the summaries being an analysis of the input,which results in the insertion of new words (e.g.
“commenters” likely isn’t seen in the input).
the in-ﬂuence of this abstraction is further seen by an anal-ysis of the extractive oracle, for which we showrouge-1/2/l (lin, 2004).
we see that the perfor-mance of an extractive model is above the extrac-tive oracle on the very abstractive xsum (narayanet al., 2018) (29.79 rouge-1), but much lowerthan the extractive oracle on the cnn-dailymail(cnndm) dataset (nallapati et al., 2016) (>50rouge-1).
the summary lengths are fairly con-sistent, while the input lengths are the longest fornyt and stack data.
we include the title and addi-tional meta-data such as the headline and snippetin nyt data in input length calculations..we analyze multi-document summarization–speciﬁc characteristics of our datasets, as proposedby dey et al.
(2020a).
in particular, inter-documentsimilarity measures the degree of overlap of seman-tic units in the candidate documents, with scoresfurther from zero signifying less overlap.
the no-tion introduced for redundancy measures the over-all distribution of semantic units; the farther thescore is from zero, the more uniform semantic unitsare across the entire input, with the maximum wheneach unit is present only once.
layout bias mea-.
sures the similarity of multi-sentential documentswith the reference.
for more precise deﬁnitions,we refer the reader to dey et al.
(2020a).
we pro-vide results for our data in table 3. email dataexhibits the most inter-document similarity, whichfollows the intuition that an email thread consistsof a focused discussion typically on a single topic.
for redundancy, we see reddit shows the most uni-form distribution of semantic units, perhaps dueto reddit threads’ less focused nature comparedto the remaining datasets.
we do not see a partic-ularly strong layout bias across any parts of theinput documents.
our datasets exhibit greater orcomparable levels of novel-ngrams compared tomulti-document summarization datasets such asmultinews (fabbri et al., 2019) and cqasumm(chowdhury and chakraborty, 2018).
our stacksubset has lower inter-document similarity, whichpresents challenges for models which rely strictlyon redundancy in the input, and our datasets gener-ally exhibit less layout bias, when compared to theanalysis done in dey et al.
(2020b)..comparison to existing datasets althoughprevious work on conversation summarization, be-fore the introduction of samsum (gliwa et al.,2019b), has largely featured unsupervised or few-shot methods, there exist several datasets with ref-erence summaries.
these include sensei (barkeret al., 2016b) for news comments, the argumen-tative dialogue summary corpus (ads) (misraet al., 2015) for discussion forums, and the bc3(ulrich et al., 2009) dataset for email data.
how-ever, much of the existing datasets are not widein scope.
for example, sensei only covers sixtopics and the ads corpus covers one topic andonly has 45 dialogues.
furthermore, they each per-tain to one subdomain of conversation.
our datasetavoids these issues by covering four diverse subdo-mains of conversation and having approximately500 annotated summaries for each subdomain.
ad-ditionally, since neural abstractive summarizationbaselines do not exist for these datasets, we bench-mark our models on these datasets to further theiruse as test sets.
we similarly include the ami andicsi meeting datasets within our benchmark..within community question answering, the wik-ihowqa dataset (deng et al., 2020) consists ofuser response threads to non-factoid questions start-ing with “how to,” including labels for the an-swer selection task and reference summaries.

answers inwhich the best answer could be used as a referencesummary.
however, this heuristic is not guaranteedto cover all the user answers’ perspectives, so webelieve our dataset is a more principled benchmarkfor community question answering..it is also noted that several large-scale mdsdatasets have been introduced in the news domain(fabbri et al., 2019; gu et al., 2020; gholipour gha-landari et al., 2020), for creating wikipedia lead-paragraphs (liu et al., 2018), and for long-formquestion answering (fan et al., 2019).
however,these do not focus on the conversational domain..4 argument graph summarization.
as our annotation protocol is motivated by theissues-viewpoints-assertions framework proposedin barker and gaizauskas (2016a), we propose toinstantiate a modiﬁed version of that work’s theo-retical, proposed graph model..argument graph construction we build onthe argument graph formulation of lenz et al.
(2020), a variant of argument interchange format(chesnevar et al., 2006).
claims and premises arerepresented as information nodes (i-nodes), withthe relations between them represented as schemenodes (s-nodes).
let v = i ∪ s be the set ofnodes, and e ⊂ v × v the set of edges describingsupport relationships among the nodes.
we thendeﬁne the argument graph g = (v, e)..lenz et al.
(2020) breaks the construction of theargument graph down into four steps: (1) argumentextraction, or the identiﬁcation of argumentativediscourse units; (2) relationship type classiﬁcation,or the classiﬁcation of edges between nodes; (3)major claim detection; and (4) graph construction,.
or the construction of the ﬁnal graph based on theidentiﬁed nodes and edges.
to adapt this formula-tion to our multi-document setting, we ﬁrst performargument extraction and relationship type classi-ﬁcation for each individual input document andﬁnally graph construction to determine relation-ships among claims from all documents..argument extraction for extracting argumentsfrom a single document, we build on work in argu-ment mining with pretrained models (chakrabartyet al., 2019).
as in lenz et al.
(2020), our argumen-tative units are sentences, from which we identifyclaims, which are assertions that something is true,and premises, which are propositions from which aconclusion is drawn.
additionally, we identify andremove non-argumentative units.
we train a three-way classiﬁer for the task of argument extraction,following chakrabarty et al.
(2019) and makinguse of data for argument mining from that paperand from stab and gurevych (2014).
the outputof this step can also simply be used without furthergraph construction as a less noisy version of theinput, which we call -arg-ﬁltered..relationship type classiﬁcation we follow theprocedure in lenz et al.
(2020) and use entailmentto determine the relationship between argumen-tative units within a document.
however, ratherthan using the classiﬁer provided, we make useof roberta (liu et al., 2019b) ﬁne-tuned on themnli entailment dataset (williams et al., 2018).
rather than using both support and contradictionedges between claims and premises, we make thesimpliﬁcation that all relationships can be capturedwith support edges, as we are dealing with a singledocument in this step.

bothare trained on 200 points from convosumm..premise can be tied as following from one of theclaims.
we create an edge between any premiseand the claim it most entails if the entailment scorefrom roberta is greater than 0.33, based on man-ual analysis of the scores.
if a premise is not labeledas supporting a claim, then we heuristically createan edge between that premise and the closest claimpreceding it in the text..since not all texts in the benchmark datasets maybe argumentative or may be too short to containmajor claims, we use some heuristics in our graphcreation.
if none of the argumentative sentences arelabeled as claims (i.e., all are labeled as premises)in argument extraction, the text’s ﬁrst sentence islabeled as the claim.
furthermore, we do not iden-tify a single claim as the major claim since theremay be multiple major points of discussion..graph construction for the ﬁnal graph, foreach of the documents in an example, we run theabove procedure and obtain a set of claims and as-sociated premises.
we then identify support edgesbetween claims, which may be across documents.
one claim may make a larger assertion, which issupported by other claims.
we run our entailmentmodel over all potential edges (in both directions)among claims in the document and greedily addedges according to the entailment support scorewhile no cycles are made.
after this step, we areleft with a set of claims which do not entail anyother nodes or, stated otherwise, do not have parentnodes.
following the terminology of barker andgaizauskas (2016b), these nodes can be consideredviewpoints..we then identify issues or topics on which theviewpoints differ.
we run our entailment model forall parent claim nodes again in both directions overthese claims and identify nodes that contradict eachother with probability over 0.33, based on manualanalysis of the resulting graphs.
we greedily addedges to maintain a tree structure, joining thesenodes to a special node, which we call the issuenode.
all issue nodes, as well as claims which arenot connected to any issue node, are connected to.
a dummy ‘conversation node’ which serves as theroot of the argument graph.
we show an exampleissue subgraph for nyt data in figure 1..argument graphs to summaries recent workhas shown the strength of text-based pretrainedmodels on graph-to-text problems (ribeiro et al.,2020).
following that work, we linearize the graphby following a depth-ﬁrst approach starting fromthe conversation node.
we found that insertingspecial tokens to signify edge types did not im-prove performance, likely due to the size of ourdata, and simply make use of an arrow → to sig-nify the relationship between sentences.
we traina sequence-to-sequence model on our linearizedgraph input, which we call -arg-graph..5 experimental settings.
we use the fairseq codebase (ott et al., 2019) forour experiments.
our base abstractive text summa-rization model is bart-large (lewis et al., 2020),a pretrained denoising autoencoder with 336m pa-rameters that builds on the sequence-to-sequencetransformer of vaswani et al.
(2017).
we ﬁne-tune bart using a polynomial decay learning ratescheduler with adam optimizer (kingma and ba,2015).
we used a learning rate of 3e-5 and warmupand total updates of 20 and 200, following previ-ous few-shot transfer work (fabbri et al., 2020a).
we could have equally ﬁne-tuned other pretrainedmodels such as pegasus (zhang et al., 2019) ort5 (raffel et al., 2019), but fabbri et al.
(2020a)ﬁnd that bart largely performs equally well infew-shot settings when compared to pegasus..for the nyt and stack datasets, which con-tain sequences over the typical 1024 max encoderlength with which bart is trained, we copied theencoder positional embeddings to allow sequencesup to length 2048. to address the input-length ofmeeting summaries, which range from 6k to 12k to-kens, we use the longformer (beltagy et al., 2020),which allows for sequences up to length 16k to-.

we initialize the longformer model withbart parameters trained on the cnn-dailymaildataset, as the meeting summarization datasets con-tain fewer than 100 data points.
we otherwiseﬁne-tune models from vanilla bart, following in-tuition in few-shot summarization (fabbri et al.,2020a) and based on initial experiments.

we provide results for baseline, unsupervised ex-tractive models in table 4. lexrank (erkan andradev, 2004) and textrank (mihalcea and tarau,2004), and bert-ext (miller, 2019), which makesuse of bert (devlin et al., 2019).
the unsuper-vised extractive models perform well below theextractive oracle performance, suggesting the difﬁ-culty of content selection in this setting..we train bart on 200 examples from our vali-dation set for abstractive models, using the remain-ing 50 as validation and test on the ﬁnal test set of250 examples.
we tested zero-shot transfer fromcnndm and samsum in zero-shot settings, al-though these resulted in a much lower performanceof about 28 rouge-1.
few-shot model perfor-mance is shown in table 5. the abstractive modelperforms at or above the extractive oracle, sug-gesting the need for better abstractive models..we also train on our argument mining-basedapproaches and show results in table 5. we seerouge improvements when applying bart-arg-graph for reddit, and stack data.
the -arg-ﬁlteredvariation (which, as deﬁned in section 4, is the lessnoisy version of the input produced by the argu-ment extraction step) outperformed the -arg-graphvariation on both email and nyt data.
for emaildata, however, this did not improve upon the bartbaseline, likely due to the dataset’s characteristics;email data is shorter and more linear, not beneﬁting.

we provide full resultsfor both variations in the appendix..benchmarking other conversation summa-rization datasets we benchmark our models onwidely used meeting summarization datasets.
dueto the input’s linear nature and the size of the meet-ing transcripts, we found improved results using-arg-ﬁltered to ﬁlter non-argumentative units ratherthan incorporating the graph structure.
results areshown in table 6. the longformer model performsas well or better than previous state-of-the-art re-sults on these datasets, despite not making use ofmore complex modeling structures, and we gener-ally see improvement with argument-mining..as noted above, there exist prior datasets fordialogue, community question answering, email,forum, and news comments summarization.
webenchmark results on these datasets in table 7.we outperform prior work on samsum (gliwaet al., 2019b), and cqasumm (chowdhury andchakraborty, 2018) with our bart and bart-arg-graph models, respectively.
we did not ﬁnd im-provement on samsum with the bart-arg modeldue to the extremely short and focused natureof the dialogues, analogous to email data perfor-mance.
we also provide transfer results of bartand bart-arg-graph models from our email andnews-comment data to bc3 (ulrich et al., 2009),ads (misra et al., 2015), and sensei data (barkeret al., 2016b), for which no prior neural abstractivesummarization results existed..human evaluations we collect human judg-ment annotations for two of the four quality dimen-sions studied in kryscinski et al.

wedid not include ﬂuency as an initial inspection ofthe data found ﬂuency to be of very high quality,as has shown to be the case for pretrained modelsin news summarization (fabbri et al., 2020b).
wedid not include coherence as this was generally notan issue of concern in the initial analysis..we randomly select 25 random examples fromthe reddit corpus and ten examples from the amicorpus, and output from the bart and bart-arg-graph models.
these data points were chosen todemonstrate what characteristics are realized in dif-ferences across rouge for argument-graph andargument-noise-reduction approaches.
ten exam-ples were chosen from ami due to the size of theinput and annotation constraints.
the annotatorsees the source article and randomly-ordered out-put from the model and then rates the summariesfor relevance and consistency on a likert from 1to 5, with 5 being the best score.
we averagedthe score of three native english-speaking anno-tators on each example and then across examples.
results are shown in table 8. we ﬁnd that theannotators prefer our argument mining-based ap-proaches in both dimensions.
however, the resultsare close.
furthermore, the scores for relevanceand consistency are rather low, especially on thereddit dataset and when compared to results on thecnn-dailymail dataset from fabbri et al.
(2020b).
these results demonstrate the difﬁculty of mod-eling such conversational data.
examples are in-cluded in the appendix..7 conclusion.
we propose convosumm, a benchmark of fournew, crowdsourced conversation datasets and state-of-the-art baselines on widely-used datasets thatpromote more uniﬁed progress in summarizationbeyond the news domain.
our benchmark consistsof high-quality, human-written summaries that callfor abstractive summaries and a deeper understand-.
ing of the input texts’ structure.
we provide resultsfor baseline models and propose to model the text’sargument structure, showing that such structurehelps better quantify viewpoints in non-linear in-put in both automatic and human evaluations.
ouranalysis notes challenges in modeling relevanceand consistency in abstractive conversation summa-rization when compared to news summarization..8 ethical considerations.
as we propose novel conversation summarizationdatasets and modeling components, this section isdivided into the following two parts..8.1 new dataset.
intellectual properties and privacy rights alldata for our newly-introduced datasets are avail-able online; please see the following for new yorktimes comment data2, stackexchange data3, andw3c email data4.
reddit data is available via thegoogle bigquery tool5..compensation for annotators we compen-sated the turkers approximately $12–$15 per hour.
we ﬁrst annotated examples in-house to determinethe required annotation speed.
typically, the sum-marization task took around 10 minutes, and wecompensated the workers from $2.25 to $3.00 pertask, depending on the domain and deadline re-quirements..steps taken to avoid potential problems weinteracted closely with the turkers to ensure thatcompensation was fair and that the instructionswere clear.
to maintain the quality of the dataset,we manually reviewed the crowdsourced sum-maries for language use.
initial investigation intoreddit data showed certain inappropriate languageusage, so we ﬁltered these examples automatically..8.2 nlp application.
bias biases may exist in the datasets, such as po-litical bias in the news datasets and gender bias inpotentially all of the datasets.
thus, models trainedon these datasets may propagate these biases.

6874removed data with offensive language when possi-ble..misuse potential and failure mode whenused as intended, applying the summarization mod-els described in this paper can save people muchtime.
however, the current models are still proneto producing hallucinated summaries, and in sucha case, they may contribute to misinformation onthe internet.
further research is needed to ensurethe faithfulness of abstractive summaries to addressthis issue, as this issue is present among all currentabstractive summarization models..environmental cost the experiments describedin the paper make use of v100 gpus.
we usedup to 8 gpus per experiment (depending on theexperiment; sometimes, a single gpu was used torun the maximum number of experiments in paral-lel).
the experiments may take up to a couple ofhours for the larger datasets.
several dozen experi-ments were run due to parameter search, and futurework should experiment with distilled models formore light-weight training.
we note that while ourwork required extensive experiments to draw soundconclusions, future work will be able to draw onthese insights and need not run as many large-scalecomparisons.
models in production may be trainedonce for use using the most promising settings..references.

table 9: full rouge-1/2/l results for vanilla bart,-arg-graph, and -arg-ﬁltered input.
all are trained on200 points from convosumm..b sample output.
we provide examples of model outputs to offermore insight into the datasets and models.
an ex-ample of reddit input and outputs for which themodels remain faithful to the source is found intable 10. the gold summary balances being ameta-analysis of the input documents with provid-ing sufﬁcient details.
we provide an additionalexample of outputs that struggle with consistencyand relevance in table 11. in the bart output,the model mistakes the suggestion in the input topay debt before starting a business.
in bart-arg,the model incorrectly determines relevance, as thesuggestion that one should invest in pumpkins wassarcastic and not emphasized in the input.

title: what should i draw next?
subreddit: pokemona fb user said they wanted to see a zapdos, but dependingon what people say on here, if any, i may do one that youall choose!
so help out if you want!
or don’t.
:)source documents:1. i’d like to see any of the legendary beasts, raikou,suicune, entei.
2. ooo i’m kinda thinking of suicune now.
good choice!
i’ll consider it for sure!
if not, it will deﬁnitely be verysoon!
3. pancham ← oooo good choice.
that’ll be one of thenext ones too.
4. if you have the time, i’d love to see reshiram!
← i’lldeﬁnitely do that as one of the next ones!
thank you verymuch!
5. seel?
← with your username, i may just do that soon.
← cool!
6. magikarp ← dear lord.
7. aronlairon!
8. you should girafarig because it’s the best pokemonever created no matter what anyone says.
← while iadmire your steadfast courage in how awesome giraﬁg is,i may wait on that one.
:p but.
maybe.

gold summary: commenters suggest ideas of the nextpokemon for the original poster to draw next.
each com-menter has a different suggestion including raikou, reshi-ram, seel, magikarp and lairon, and the original postercomments their thoughts on each of the suggestions witheither approval or a joking disapproval..table 10: example source documents and summariesfrom reddit data in which the models are faithful tothe source and largely relevant..output points to a need to better model interactionsand salience in the conversation data..c additional details.
for reproducibility purposes, we provide (smallestnll loss, largest nll loss) bounds on the valida-tion loss from non-baseline models encounteredwhen training on our newly-proposed datasets.
