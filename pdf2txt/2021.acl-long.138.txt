abstract.
in this paper, we present a neural model forjoint dropped pronoun recovery (dpr) andconversational discourse parsing (cdp) in chi-nese conversational speech.
we show thatdpr and cdp are closely related, and a jointmodel beneﬁts both tasks.
we refer to ourmodel as discproreco, and it ﬁrst encodesthe tokens in each utterance in a conversa-tion with a directed graph convolutional net-work (gcn).
the token states for an utter-ance are then aggregated to produce a sin-gle state for each utterance.
the utterancestates are then fed into a biafﬁne classiﬁerto construct a conversational discourse graph.
a second (multi-relational) gcn is then ap-plied to the utterance states to produce a dis-course relation-augmented representation forthe utterances, which are then fused togetherwith token states in each utterance as inputto a dropped pronoun recovery layer.
thejoint model is trained and evaluated on a newstructure parsing-enhanced dropped pronounrecovery (spdpr) dataset that we annotatedwith both two types of information.
experi-mental results on the spdpr dataset and otherbenchmarks show that discproreco signiﬁ-cantly outperforms the state-of-the-art base-lines of both tasks..1.introduction.
pronouns are often dropped in chinese conversa-tions as the identity of the pronoun can be inferredfrom the context (kim, 2000; yang et al., 2015)without causing the sentence to be incomprehensi-ble.
the task of dropped pronoun recovery (dpr)aims to locate the position of the dropped pronounand identify its type.
conversational discourse pars-ing (cdp) is another important task that aims toanalyze the discourse relations among utterances.

baselines which ignore the rela-tion “(b3 expands b2) replies a2” mistakenly recoverthe dropped pronoun 你(you) as 我(i) since the utter-ance b3 is considered semantically similar to a2..in a conversation, and plays a vital role in under-standing multi-turn conversations..existing work regards dpr and cdp as two in-dependent tasks and tackles them separately.

(pro-drop utterance)pleonastictional utterances when exploiting the context of thedropped pronoun.
at the same time, previous cdpmethods (li et al., 2014; afantenos et al., 2015;shi and huang, 2019) ﬁrst predict the relation foreach utterance pair and then construct the discoursestructure for the conversation with a decoding al-gorithm.
the effectiveness of these methods arecompromised since the utterances might be incom-plete when they have dropped pronouns..to overcome these shortcomings, we propose anovel neural model called discproreco to performdpr and cdp jointly.
figure 1 is a chinese conver-sation snippet between two speakers a and b thatillustrates the advantages of such a joint approach.
in this example, a pronoun “你 (you)” is droppedin utterance b3.
it is critical for the dpr model toknow that both utterances b2 and b3 are in replyto the utterance a2, when recovering this droppedpronoun.
methods which ignore the structure (“(b3expands b2) replies a2”) will more likely considerthe utterance b3 to be semantically similar to a2,and wrongly recover the pronoun as “我 (i)”..given a pro-drop utterance and its context, dis-cproreco parses the discourse structure of the con-versation and recovers the dropped pronouns inthe utterance in four steps: (i) each utterance isparsed into its dependency structure and fed into adirected gcn to output the syntactic token states.
the utterance state is then obtained by aggregat-ing the token states in the utterance.
(ii) the ut-terance states of a conversation are fed into a bi-afﬁne classiﬁer to predict the discourse relationbetween each utterance pair and the discourse struc-ture of the conversation is constructed.
(iii) takingthe discourse structure as input, another (multi-relational) gcn updates the utterance states andfuses them into the token states for each utteranceto produce discourse-aware token representations.
(iv) based on the discourse structure-aware con-text representation, a pronoun recovery module isdesigned to recover the dropped pronouns in the ut-terances.
when training this model, all componentsare jointly optimized by parameter sharing so thatcdp and dpr can beneﬁt each other.
as there isno public dataset annotated with both dropped pro-nouns and conversational discourse structures, wealso construct structure parsing-enhanced droppedpronoun recovery (spdpr) corpus, which is theﬁrst corpus annotated with both types of informa-tion.
experimental results show that discprorecooutperforms all baselines of cdp and dpr..contributions: this work makes the followingcontributions: (i) we propose a uniﬁed frameworkdiscproreco to jointly perform cdp and dpr, andshow that these two tasks can beneﬁt each other.
(ii) we construct a new large-scale dataset spdpr(section 4) which supports fair comparison acrossdifferent methods and facilitates future research onboth dpr and cdp.
(iii) we present experimentalresults which show that discproreco with its jointlearning mechanism realizes knowledge sharingbetween its cdp and dpr components and resultsin improvements for both tasks (section 5).
thecode and spdpr dataset is available at https://github.com/ningningyang/discproreco..2 problem formulation.
we ﬁrst introduce the problem formulation of thesetwo tasks.
following the practices in (yang et al.,2015, 2019, 2020), we formulate dpr as a se-quence labeling problem.
dpr aims to recover thedropped pronouns in an utterance by assigning oneof 17 labels to each token that indicates the typeof pronoun that is dropped before the token (yanget al., 2015).
cdp is the task of constructing theconversational discourse structure by predicting thediscourse relation (xue et al., 2016) among utter-ances.
the discourse relations may characterizeone utterance as agreeing with, responding to, orindicate understanding of another utterance in theconversational context..let us denote an input pro-drop utterance of n to-kens as x = (w1, w2, · · · , wn), and its contextualutterances as c = (x1, x2, · · · , xm) where the i-th contextual utterance xi is a sequence of li tokens:xi = (wi,1, · · · , wi,li).
our task aims to (1) modelthe distribution p(xj|xi, c) to predict the relationbetween each pair of utterances (i.e., (xi, xj)) forcdp, and (2) model ˆy = arg maxy p(y|x, c)to predict the recovered pronoun sequence ˆy forthe input utterance x. each element of ˆy ischosen from one of the t possible labels fromy = {y1, · · · , yt−1}∪{none} to indicate whethera pronoun is dropped before the corresponding to-ken in utterance x and the type of the droppedpronoun.
the label “none” means no pronoun isdropped before this token..3 the discproreco framework.
3.1 model overview.
the architecture of discproreco is illustrated infigure 2. given a pro-drop utterance x and its.
1753figure 2: overview of discproreco, which explores conversational discourse structures to learn effective referentrepresentations that are used to recover dropped pronouns.
discproreco consists of four components, and thedetails are introduced in section 3..context c, discproreco ﬁrst represents tokens ofthese utterances as d-dimensional pre-trained wordembeddings (li et al., 2018), and then feed theminto a bigru (chung et al., 2014) network, torepresent sequential token states x ∈ rn×d andc ∈ rm×lm×d as the concatenation of forwardand backward hidden states outputted from bigru.
the syntactic dependency encoding layer then re-vises the sequential token states by exploiting thesyntactic dependencies between tokens in the sameutterance using a directed gcn and generates utter-ance representations.
after that, the biafﬁne rela-tion prediction layer predicts the relation betweeneach pair of utterances.
the discourse structurethen is constructed based on the utterance nodesand the predicted relations.
the discourse structureencoding layer further encodes the inter-utterancediscourse structures with a multi-relational gcn,and employs the discourse-based utterance repre-sentations to revise the syntactic token states.
fi-nally, the pronoun recovery layer explores the ref-erent semantics from the context c and predicts thedropped pronouns in each utterance..3.2 syntactic dependency encoding layer.
as the sequentialtoken states overlook long-distance dependencies among tokens in a utterance,this layer takes in the sequential token states x andc, and revises them as syntactic token states as hxand hc by exploring the syntactic dependencies.
between the tokens based on a directed gcn..speciﬁcally, for each input utterance in x andc, we ﬁrst extract syntactic dependencies betweenthe tokens with stanford’s stanza dependencyparser (qi et al., 2020).
using the output of thedependency parser, we construct a syntactic depen-dency graph for each utterance in which the nodesrepresents the tokens and the edges correspond tothe extracted syntactic dependencies between thetokens.
following the practices of (marcheggianiand titov, 2017; vashishth et al., 2018), three typesof edges are deﬁned in the graph.
the node statesare initialized by the sequential token states x andc, and then message passing is performed over theconstructed graph using the directed gcn (kipfand welling, 2017), referred to as syngcn.
thesyntactic dependency representation of token wi,nafter (k + 1)-th gcn layer is deﬁned as:.

in the trainingphase, we also minimize the cross-entropy betweengold relation labels and the predicted relations be-tween utterances as:.
3.3 biafﬁne relation prediction layer.
i,j.
i,j.
and relation s(rel).
for conversational discourse parsing, we jointlypredict the arc s(arc)betweeneach pair of utterances utilizing the biafﬁne atten-tion mechanism proposed in (dozat and manning,2017).
given the syntactic token states hx andhc, we make an average aggregation on thesetoken states of each utterance xi to obtain the syn-tactic utterance representation hxi..for a pair of utterances (xi, xj) in the conversa-tion snippet, we feed the representations of thesetwo utterances into a biafﬁne function to predictthe probability of an arc from xi to xj as:.
r(arc head)i.
= mlp(arc head)(hxi),.
r(arc dep)j.
= mlp(arc dep)(hxj ),.
i.i.u(arc),.
+ r(arc head)t.u(arc)r(arc dep)j.i,j = r(arc head)s(arc)where mlp is the multi-layer perceptron that trans-forms the original utterance representation hxiand hxj into head or dependent-speciﬁc utterancestates r(arc head)and r(arc dep).
u(arc) and u(arc)jiare weight matrix and bias term used to determinethe probability of a arc..one distinctive characteristics of conversationaldiscourse parsing is that the head of each depen-dent utterance must be chosen from the utterancesbefore the dependent utterance.
thus we add anupper triangular mask operation on the results ofarc prediction to regularize the predicted arc head:.
s(arc) = mask(s(arc))..we minimize the cross-entropy of gold head-.

lossarc = −.
δ(xj|xi, c) log(parc(xj|xi, c)),.
m(cid:88).
j=1.
parc(xj|xi, c) = softmax(s(arc).
)..i.after obtaining the predicted directed unlabeledarc between each utterance pair, we calculate thescore distribution s(rel)i,j ∈ rk of each arc xi → xj,in which the t-th element indicates the score of.
lossrel = − (cid:80)n.j=1 δ(xj|xi, c) log(prel(xj|xi, c)),.
prel(xj|xi, c) = softmax(s(rel).
i,j )..3.4 discourse structure encoding layer.
after the relations are predicted, we construct thediscourse structure as a multi-relational graph inwhich each node indicates an utterance, and eachedge represents the relation between a pair of utter-ances.
in order to utilize the discourse informationin dropped pronoun recovery process, we ﬁrst en-code the discourse structure, and then utilize thediscourse information-based utterance representa-tions to improve token states which are used tomodel the pronoun referent..speciﬁcally, we apply a multiple relationalgcn (vashishth et al., 2020), referred to as rel-gcn, over the graph to encode the discourse struc-ture based utterance representations r and utilizethe updated representations to further revise syn-tactic token states hx and hc for outputting dis-course structure based token states z x and z c.the node states of the graph are initialized as theaverage aggregation of token states of correspond-ing utterances.
the representation of utterance xiin the (k + 1)-th layer is updated by incorporatingthe discourse relation state hk.
rel as:.
rk+1i = f.(cid:16)(cid:80).
(j,rel)∈n (xi) prel(xj|xi, c)wk.
λ(rel)φ.j , hkrkrel.

where rkrel denote the updated representa-tion of utterance j and relation rel after the k-thλ(rel) ∈ rd×d is a relation-gcn layers, and wktype speciﬁc parameter.
following the practiceof(vashishth et al., 2020), we take the compo-sition operator φ as multiplication in this work.
please note that we take in the label distributionprel(xj|xi, c) from the relation prediction layerand compute the weighted sum of each kind of re-lation to update the utterance representation, ratherthan taking the hard predicted relation by applyingan argmax operation over the distribution..after encoding the constructed discourse struc-ture with a message passing process, we obtain thediscourse relation-augmented utterance represen-tations r, and then utilize the updated utterance.

this layer takes in the revised token representationsz x and z c, and attempts to ﬁnd tokens in contextc that describe the referent of the dropped pronounin the pro-drop utterance x with an attention mech-anism.
the referent representation is then capturedas the weighted sum of discourse context-basedtoken states as:.

the total trainingobjective is deﬁned as:.
loss = α · (lossarc + losslabel) + β · lossdp,.
(1).
where α and β are weights of cdp objective func-tion and dpr objective function respectively..4 the spdpr dataset.
to verify the effectiveness of discproreco, weneed a conversational corpus containing the an-notation of both dropped pronouns and discourserelations.
to our knowledge, there is no such a pub-lic available corpus.
therefore, we constructed theﬁrst structure parsing-enhanced dropped pronounrecovery (spdpr) dataset by annotating the dis-course structure information on a popular droppedpronoun recovery dataset (i.e., chinese sms)..the chinese sms/chat dataset consists of 684multi-party chat ﬁles and is a popular benchmarkfor dropped pronoun recovery (yang et al., 2015).
in this study, we set the size of the context snip-pet to be 8 utterances which include the currentpro-drop utterance plus 5 utterances before and 2utterances after.
when performing discourse re-lation annotation we ask three linguistic expertsto independently choose a head utterance for thecurrent utterance from its context and annotate thediscourse relation between them according to aset of 8 pre-deﬁned relations (see appendix a).
the inter-annotator agreement for discourse rela-tion annotation is 0.8362, as measured by fleiss’skappa.
the resulting spdpr dataset consists of292,455 tokens and 40,280 utterances, averaging4,949 utterance pairs per relation, with a minimumof 540 pairs for the least frequent relation and amaximum of 12,252 for the most frequent relation.
the spdpr dataset also annotates 31,591 droppedpronouns (except the “none” category)..5 experiments.

we remove 13 typesof them which connects the punctuation with othertokens, and irrelevant to referent description.
dur-ing training, we utilized adam optimizer (kingmaand ba, 2015) with a 0.005 learning rate and trainedour model for 30 epochs.
the model performedbest on the validation set is used to make predic-tions on the test set.
we repeat each experiment 10times and records the average results..5.2 dropped pronoun recovery.
datasets and evaluation metrics we tested theperformance of discproreco for dpr on threedatasets: (1) tc section of ontonotes release5.0, which is a transcription of chinese telephoneconversations, and is released in the conll 2012shared task.
(2) baiduzhidao, which is a questionanswering corpus (zhang et al., 2019).
ten typesof concrete pronouns were annotated according tothe pre-deﬁned guidelines.
these two benchmarksdo not contain the discourse structure informationand are mainly used to evaluate the effectiveness ofour model for dpr task.
(3) the spdpr dataset,which contains 684 conversation ﬁles annotatedwith dropped pronouns and discourse relations.
fol-lowing practice in (yang et al., 2015, 2019), wereserve the same 16.7% of the training instancesas the development set, and a separate test set wasused to evaluate the models.
the statistics of thethree datasets are shown in appendix b..same as existing efforts (yang et al., 2015, 2019),we use precision(p), recall(r) and f-score(f)as metrics when evaluating the performance ofdropped pronoun models.
baselines we compared discproreco against ex-.
isting baselines, including: (1) mepr (yang et al.,2015), which leverages a maximum entropy clas-siﬁer to predict the type of dropped pronoun be-fore each token; (2) nrm (zhang et al., 2019),which employs two mlps to predict the positionand type of a dropped pronoun separately; (3) bi-gru, which utilizes a bidirectional gru to encodeeach token in a pro-drop sentence and then makesprediction; (4) ndpr (yang et al., 2019), whichmodels the referents of dropped pronouns from alarge context with a structured attention mecha-nism; (5) transformer-gcrf (yang et al., 2020),which jointly recovers the dropped pronouns ina conversational snippet with general conditionalrandom ﬁelds; (6) xlm-roberta-ndpr, whichutilizes the pre-trained multilingual masked lan-guage model (conneau et al., 2020) to encode thepro-drop utterance and its context, and then em-ploys the attention mechanism in ndpr to modelthe referent semantics..we also compare two variants of discproreco:(1) discproreco (xlm-r-w/o relgcn), whichreplaces the bigru encoder with the pre-trainedxlm-roberta model, removes the relgcnlayer, and only utilizes syngcn to encode syntac-tic token representations for predicting the droppedpronouns.

we attribute this to the ability of our model toconsider long-distance syntactic dependencies be-tween tokens in the same utterance.
note thatthe results for feature-based baseline mepr (yanget al., 2015) on ontonotes, and baiduzhidao arenot available because several essential featurescannot been obtained.
however, our proposeddiscproreco still signiﬁcantly outperforms dis-cproreco (xlm-r-w/o relgcn) as it achieved3.26%, 1.40%, and 1.70% absolute improvementsin terms of precision, recall and f-score respec-tively on spdpr corpus.
this shows that discourserelations between utterances are crucially impor-tant for modeling the referent of dropped pronounsand achieving better performance in dropped pro-noun recovery.
this is consistent with the obser-vation in (ghosal et al., 2019).
the best resultsare achieved when our model uses uses the pre-trained xlm-roberta (i.e., discproreco(xlm-r)).
note that discourse relations are not availablefor ontonotes and baiduzhidao datasets and thuswe do not have joint learning results for these twodata sets.
error analysis we further investigated some typ-ical mistakes made by our discproreco for dpr.
resolving dpr involves effectively modeling thereferent of each dropped pronoun from the contextto recover the dropped pronoun.
as illustrate infigure 3, both discproreco and ndpr model thereferent from the context.
the former outperformsthe latter since it considers the conversation struc-ture that the utterance b3 is a reply to a3 but not anexpansion to the utterance b1.
however, just mod-eling the referent from the context is insufﬁcient.
in figure 3, the referent of the dropped pronoun.
was correctly identiﬁed but the dropped pronoun ismistakenly identiﬁed as “(他们/they)”.
this indi-cates that the model needs to be augmented withsome additional knowledge, such as the differencebetween singular and plural pronouns..5.3 conversational discourse parsing.
datasets and evaluation metrics we evaluatedthe effectiveness of our discproreco frameworkfor cdp task on two datasets as: (1) stac, whichis a standard benchmark for discourse parsing onmulti-party dialogue (asher and lascarides, 2005).
the dataset contains 1,173 dialogues, 12,867 edusand 12,476 relations.
same as existing studies,we set aside 10% of the training dialogues as thevalidation data.

following (shi and huang,2019), we also utilized micro-averaged f-score asthe evaluation metric.
baselines we compared our discproreco with ex-isting baseline methods: (1) mst (afantenos et al.,2015): a approach that uses local information intwo utterances to predict the discourse relation, anduses the maximum spanning tree (mst) to con-struct the discourse structure; (2) ilp (perret et al.,2016): same as mst except that the mst algo-rithm is replaced with integer linear programming(ilp); (3) deep+mst: a neural network that en-codes the discourse representations with gru, andthen uses mst to construct the discourse structure;(4) deep+ilp: same as deep+mst except thatthe mst algorithm is replaced with integer linearprogramming (ilp); (5) deep+greedy: similar todeep+mst and deep+ilp except that this modeluses a greedy decoding algorithm to select the par-ent for each utterance; (6) deep sequential (shiand huang, 2019): a deep sequential neural net-.

experimental results we list the experimentalresults of our approach and the baselines in ta-ble 2. for the stac dataset, we also reported theoriginal results of the stac benchmark from anexisting paper (shi and huang, 2019), and applyour discproreco to this corpus.
for the spdprdataset, we ran the baseline methods with the sameparameter settings.
from the results we can seethat the variant of our approach discproreco (w/odpr) outperforms the baselines of discourse pars-ing.
we attribute this to the effectiveness of thebiafﬁne attention mechanism for dependency pars-ing task (yan et al., 2020; ji et al., 2019).
however,our approach discproreco still signiﬁcantly outper-forms all the compared models.
we attribute this tothe joint training of the cdp task and the dpr task.
the parameter sharing mechanism makes these twotasks beneﬁts each other.
note that the results forthe joint model is not available for stac as stacis not annotated with dropped pronouns..5.4.interaction between dpr and cdp.
we also conducted experiments on spdpr to studythe quantitative interaction between dpr and cdp.
firstly, during the training process, we optimize ourdiscproreco model utilizing the objective functionin eq.
1 until the cdp task achieves a speciﬁc f-score (i.e., gradually increases from 30.64 to 50.38).
then we ﬁx the cdp components and continue tooptimize the components of dpr task.
we conductthis experiment to explore the inﬂuence of cdptask on the dpr task.
secondly, we set the ratiobetween α and β in eq.
1 varies from 0.25 to 1.25and record the f-score of dpr and cdp respec-tively.
we conduct this experiment to study theinteranction between these two tasks by modifyingtheir weights in the objective function..results of these two experiments are shown infigure 4. according to figure 4 (a), the perfor-mance of dpr is increased in terms of all eval-uation metrics as the f-score of cdp increases,which indicates that exploring the discourse rela-tions between utterances beneﬁts dropped pronoun.

moreover, figure 4 (b) illustrate the per-formance of dpr and cdp when the ratio betweenα to β varies gradually.
results show that the per-formance of cdp remains stable, while the per-formance of dpr increases at beginning and thendecrease sharply as the ratio increases, indicatingthat discproreco framework should pay more at-tention to dpr during the optimizing process..6 related work.
dropped pronoun recovery is a criticaltech-nique that can beneﬁt many downstream appli-cations (wang et al., 2016, 2018; su et al.,2019).
yang et al.
(2015) for the ﬁrst time pro-posed this task, and utilized a maximum entropyclassiﬁer to recover the dropped pronouns in textmessages.
giannella et al.
(2017) further employeda linear-chain crf to jointly predict the positionand type of the dropped pronouns in a single utter-ance using hand-crafted features.
due to the power-ful semantic modeling capability of deep learning,zhang et al.
(2019); yang et al.
(2019) introducedneural network methods to recover the dropped pro-noun by modeling its semantics from the context.
all these methods represent the utterances withoutconsidering the relationship between utterances,which is important to identify the referents.
zeropronoun resolution is also a closely related line ofresearch to dpr (chen and ng, 2016; yin et al.,2017, 2018).
the main difference between dprand zero pronoun resolution task is that dpr con-siders both anaphoric and non-anaphoric pronouns,and doesn’t attempt to resolve it to a referent..17593035404550f-score of arc prediction in cdp444648505254565860performance of dprprecisionrecallf-score0.20.40.60.81.01.2ratio between  to 4446485052545658f-score of dpr and cdpdprcdpexisting discourse parsing methods ﬁrst pre-dicted the probability of discourse relation, andthen applied a decoding algorithm to construct thediscourse structure (muller et al., 2012; li et al.,2014; afantenos et al., 2015; perret et al., 2016).
a deep sequential model (shi and huang, 2019)was further presented to predict the discourse de-pendencies utilizing both local information of twoutterances and the global information of existingconstructed discourse structure.
all these methodsconsider how to do relation prediction indepen-dently.
however, in this work, we explore the con-nection between the cdp and dpr, and attempt tomake these two tasks mutually enhance each other..7 conclusion.
this paper presents that dropped pronoun recov-ery and conversational discourse parsing are twostrongly related tasks.
to make them beneﬁt fromeach other, we devise a novel framework calleddiscproreco to tackle these two tasks simultane-ously.
the framework is trained in a joint learningparadigm, and the parameters for the two tasks arejointly optimized.
to facilitate the study of theproblem, we created a large-scale dataset calledspdpr which contains the annotations of bothdropped pronouns and discourse relations.
experi-mental results demonstrated that discproreco out-performed all baselines on both tasks..acknowledgments.

the discourse relation describes a participant mayspeak a utterance to agree with, respond to, or indi-cate understanding of another utterance in the con-versational context.
according to (xue et al., 2016), each utterance is assumed only related to one pre-vious utterance.
all relations are summarized as6 types between same-participant utterance pairs,and 2 types between different-participant utterancepairs, as summarized in table 3..b statistics of dpr datasets.
the statistics of three dropped pronoun recoverybenchmarks (i.e., spdpr, tc section of ontonotesand baiduzhidao) are shown in table 4..1763
