abstract.
bilingual lexicons map words in one languageto their translations in another, and are typi-cally induced by learning linear projections toalign monolingual word embedding spaces.
inthis paper, we show it is possible to producemuch higher quality lexicons with methodsthat combine (1) unsupervised bitext miningand (2) unsupervised word alignment.
directlyapplying a pipeline that uses recent algorithmsfor both subproblems signiÔ¨Åcantly improvesinduced lexicon quality and further gains arepossible by learning to Ô¨Ålter the resulting lex-ical entries, with both unsupervised and semi-supervised schemes.
our Ô¨Ånal model outper-forms the state of the art on the bucc 2020shared task by 14 f1 points averaged over 12language pairs, while also providing a more in-terpretable approach that allows for rich rea-soning of word meaning in context.
furtheranalysis of our output and the standard refer-ence lexicons suggests they are of comparablequality, and new benchmarks may be neededto measure further progress on this task.1.
1.introduction.
bilingual lexicons map words in one language totheir translations in another, and can be automati-cally induced by learning linear projections to alignmonolingual word embedding spaces (artetxeet al., 2016; smith et al., 2017; lample et al., 2018,inter alia).
although very successful in practice,the linear nature of these methods encodes unrealis-tic simplifying assumptions (e.g.
all translations ofa word have similar embeddings).
in this paper, weshow it is possible to produce much higher qualitylexicons without these restrictions by introducingnew methods that combine (1) unsupervised bitextmining and (2) unsupervised word alignment..‚àówork done during internship at facebook ai research.
1code is publicly available at https://github.com/.
facebookresearch/bitext-lexind..we show that simply pipelining recent algo-rithms for unsupervised bitext mining (tran et al.,2020) and unsupervised word alignment (sabetet al., 2020) signiÔ¨Åcantly improves bilingual lexi-con induction (bli) quality, and that further gainsare possible by learning to Ô¨Ålter the resulting lexi-cal entries.
improving on a recent method for doingbli via unsupervised machine translation (artetxeet al., 2019), we show that unsupervised miningproduces better bitext for lexicon induction thantranslation, especially for less frequent words..these core contributions are established by sys-tematic experiments in the class of bitext construc-tion and alignment methods (figure 1).
our fullinduction algorithm Ô¨Ålters the lexicon found viathe initial unsupervised pipeline.
the Ô¨Åltering canbe either fully unsupervised or weakly-supervised:for the former, we Ô¨Ålter using simple heuristics andglobal statistics; for the latter, we train a multi-layerperceptron (mlp) to predict the probability of aword pair being in the lexicon, where the featuresare global statistics of word alignments..in addition to bli, our method can also be di-rectly adapted to improve word alignment andreach competitive or better alignment accuracy thanthe state of the art on all investigated languagepairs.
we Ô¨Ånd that improved alignment in sentencerepresentations (tran et al., 2020) leads to bettercontextual word alignments using local similarity(sabet et al., 2020)..our Ô¨Ånal bli approach outperforms the previ-ous state of the art on the bucc 2020 shared task(rapp et al., 2020) by 14 f1 points averaged over12 language pairs.
manual analysis shows thatmost of our false positives are due to the incom-pleteness of the reference and that our lexicon iscomparable to the reference lexicon and the out-put of a supervised system.
because both of ourkey building blocks make use of the pretraininedcontextual representations from mbart (liu et al.,.

best viewed in color..2020) and criss (tran et al., 2020), we can alsointerpret these results as clear evidence that lexiconinduction beneÔ¨Åts from contextualized reasoningat the token level, in strong contrast to nearly allexisting methods that learn linear projections onword types..2 related work.
bilingual lexicon induction (bli).
the task ofbli aims to induce a bilingual lexicon (i.e., wordtranslation) from comparable monolingual corpora(e.g., wikipedia in different languages).
followingmikolov et al.
(2013), most methods train a linearprojection to align two monolingual embeddingspaces.
for supervised bli, a seed lexicon is usedto learn the projection matrix (artetxe et al., 2016;smith et al., 2017; joulin et al., 2018).
for un-supervised bli, the projection matrix is typicallyfound by an iterative procedure such as adversariallearning (lample et al., 2018; zhang et al., 2017),or iterative reÔ¨Ånement initialized by a statisticalheuristics (hoshen and wolf, 2018; artetxe et al.,2018).
artetxe et al.
(2019) show strong gains overprevious works by word aligning bitext generatedwith unsupervised machine translation.
we showthat retrieval-based bitext mining and contextualword alignment achieves even better performance..word alignment.
word alignment is a funda-mental problem in statistical machine translation,of which the goal is to align words that are transla-tions of each in within parallel sentences (brownet al., 1993).
most methods assume parallel sen-tences for training data (och and ney, 2003; dyeret al., 2013; peter et al., 2017, inter alia).
incontrast, sabet et al.
(2020) propose simalign,which does not train on parallel sentences but in-stead aligns words that have the most similar pre-.
trained multilingual representations (devlin et al.,2019; conneau et al., 2019).
simalign achievescompetitive or superior performance than conven-tional alignment methods despite not using parallelsentences, and provides one of the baseline com-ponents for our work.
we also present a simpleyet effective method to improve performance oversimalign (section 5)..bitext mining/parallel corpus mining.
bitextmining has been a long studied task (resnik, 1999;shi et al., 2006; abdul-rauf and schwenk, 2009,inter alia).
most methods train neural multilingualencoders on bitext, which are then used with efÔ¨Å-cent nearest neighbor search to expand the trainingset (espana-bonet et al., 2017; schwenk, 2018;guo et al., 2018; artetxe and schwenk, 2019a, in-ter alia).
recent work has also shown that unsuper-vised mining is possible (tran et al., 2020; keunget al., 2020).
we use criss (tran et al., 2020)2 asone of our component models..3 baseline components.
we build on unsupervised methods for word align-ment and bitext construction, as reviewed below..3.1 unsupervised word alignment.
simalign (sabet et al., 2020) is an unsupervisedword aligner based on the similarity of contextu-alized token embeddings.
given a pair of parallelsentences, simalign computes embeddings us-ing pretrained multilingual language models suchas mbert and xlm-r, and forms a matrix whoseentries are the cosine similarities between everysource token vector and every target token vector..2https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/.

to increaserecall, sabet et al.
(2020) also propose itermax,which applies argmax iteratively while excludingpreviously aligned positions..3.2 unsupervised bitext construction.
we consider two methods for bitext construc-tion: unsupervised machine translation (generation;artetxe et al., 2019, section 3.2) and bitext retrieval(retrieval; tran et al., 2020, section 3.2)..generation artetxe et al.
(2019) train an unsu-pervised machine translation model with mono-lingual corpora, generate bitext with the obtainedmodel, and further use the generated bitext to in-duce bilingual lexicons.
we replace their statisticalunsupervised translation model with criss, a re-cent high quality unsupervised machine translationmodel which is expected to produce much higherquality bitext (i.e., translations).
for each sentencein the two monolingual corpora, we generate atranslation to the other language using beam searchor nucleus sampling (holtzman et al., 2020)..retrieval tran et al.
(2020) show that the crissencoder module provides as a high-quality sentenceencoder for cross-lingual retrieval: they take theaverage across the contextualized embeddings oftokens as sentence representation, perform near-est neighbor search with faiss (johnson et al.,2019),3 and mine bitext using the margin-basedmax-score method (artetxe and schwenk, 2019a).4the score between sentence representations s.and t is deÔ¨Åned by.

4we used max-score (artetxe and schwenk, 2019a) as it.
strongly outperforms the other methods they proposed..bilingual word pairs as the induced lexicon.
theframework consists of two parts: (i) an unsuper-vised bitext construction module which generatesor retrieves bitext from separate monolingual cor-pora without explicit supervision (section 3.2), and(ii) a lexicon induction module which induces bilin-gual lexicon from the constructed bitext based onthe statistics of cross-lingual word alignment.
forthe lexicon induction module, we compare twoapproaches:fully unsupervised induction (sec-tion 4.1) which does not use any extra supervision,and weakly supervised induction (section 4.2) thatuses a seed lexicon as input..4.1 fully unsupervised induction.
we align the constructed bitext with criss-basedsimalign, and propose to use smoothed matchedratio for a pair of bilingual word type (cid:104)s, t(cid:105).
œÅ(s, t) =.
mat(s, t)coc(s, t) + Œª.as the metric to induce lexicon, where mat(s, t)and coc(s, t) denote the one-to-one matching count(e.g., guten-good; figure 1) and co-occurrencecount of (cid:104)s, t(cid:105) appearing in a sentence pair respec-tively, and Œª is a non-negative smoothing term.5.
during inference, we predict the target wordt with the highest œÅ(s, t) for each source words. like most previous work (artetxe et al., 2016;smith et al., 2017; lample et al., 2018, inter alia),this method translates each source word to exactlyone target word..4.2 weakly supervised induction.
we also propose a weakly supervised method,which assumes access to a seed lexicon.
this lexi-con is used to train a classiÔ¨Åer to further Ô¨Ålter thepotential lexical entries..for a pair of word type (cid:104)s, t(cid:105), our classiÔ¨Åer uses.
the following global features:.
‚Ä¢ count of alignment: we consider both one-to-one alignment (section 4.1) and many-to-onealignment (e.g., danke-you and danke-thank;figure 1) of s and t separately as two features,since the task of lexicon induction is arguablybiased toward one-to-one alignment..‚Ä¢ count of co-occurrence used in section 4.1..5we use Œª = 20. this reduces the effect of noisy align-the most extreme case is that both mat(s, t) andment:coc(s, t) are 1, but it is probably not desirable despite thehigh matched ratio of 1..815‚Ä¢ the count of s in the source language and t in.
the target language.6.
‚Ä¢ non-contextualized word similarity: we feedthe word type itself into criss, use the av-erage pooling of the output subword embed-dings, and consider both cosine similarity anddot-product similarity as features..for a counting feature c, we take log (c + Œ∏c),where Œ∏ consists of learnable parameters.
there are7 features in total, which is denoted by x(cid:104)s,t(cid:105) ‚àà r7.
we compute the probability of a pair of words(cid:104)s, t(cid:105) being in the induced lexicon pŒ∏(s, t)7 by arelu activated multi-layer perceptron (mlp):.

where d+ and d‚àí denotes the positive training set(i.e., the seed lexicon) and the negative training setrespectively.
we construct the negative trainingset by extracting all bilingual word pairs that co-occurred but are not in the seed word pairs..we tune two hyperparameters Œ¥ and n to max-imize the f1 score on the seed lexicon and usethem for inference, where Œ¥ denotes the predictionthreshold and n denotes the maximum number oftranslations for each source word, following lavilleet al.
(2020) who estimate these hyperparametersbased on heuristics.
the inference algorithm issummarized in algorithm 1..5 extension to word alignment.
the idea of using an mlp to induce lexicon withweak supervision (section 4.2) can be directly ex-tended to word alignment.

sabet et al.
(2020) has proposeddifferent algorithms to induce alignment from thesame similarity matrix, and the best method variesacross language pairs.
in this work, we considerthe relatively conservative (i.e., having higher pre-cision) argmax and the higher recall itermax al-gorithm (sabet et al., 2020), and denote the align-ments by aargmax and aitermax respectively..we substitute the non-contextualized word sim-ilarity feature (section 4.2) with contextualizedword similarity where the corresponding word em-bedding is computed by averaging the Ô¨Ånal-layercontextualized subword embeddings of criss.
the cosine similarities and dot-products of theseembeddings are included as features..instead of the binary classiÔ¨Åcation in section 4.2,we do ternary classiÔ¨Åcation for word alignments.
for a pair of word tokens (cid:104)si, tj(cid:105), the gold labely(cid:104)si,tj (cid:105) is deÔ¨Åned as.
1[(cid:104)i, j(cid:105) ‚àà aargmax] + 1[(cid:104)i, j(cid:105) ‚àà aitermax]..intuitively, the labels 0 and 2 represents conÔ¨Å-dent alignment or non-alignment by both methods,while the label 1 models the potential alignment.

6 experimental setup and baselines.
throughout our experiments, we use a two-layerperceptron with the hidden size of 8 for both lexi-con induction and word alignment.
we optimize allof our models using adam (kingma and ba, 2015)with the initial learning rate 5 √ó 10‚àí4.
for ourbitext construction methods, we retrieve the bestmatching sentence or translate the sentences in thesource language wikipedia; for baseline models,we use their default settings..for evaluation, we use the bucc 2020 blishared task dataset (rapp et al., 2020) and met-ric (f1).
like most recent work, this evaluation isbased on muse (lample et al., 2018).8 we primar-ily report the bucc evaluation because it considersrecall in addition to precision.
however, becausemost recent work only evaluates on precision, weinclude those evaluations in appendix d.we compare the following baselines:.

ourmethod would be considered open track since thepretrained models used a much larger data set(common crawl 25) than the bucc 2020 closed-track (wikipedia or wacky; baroni et al., 2009)..we evaluate bidirectional translations from beamsearch (gen; section 3.2), bidirectional transla-tions from nucleus sampling (gen-n; holtzmanet al., 2020),13 and retrieval (rtv; section 3.2).
inaddition, it is natural to concatenate the global sta-tistical features (section 4.2) from both gen andrtv and we refer to this approach by gen-rtv..our main results are presented in table 1. all ofour models (gen, gen-n, rtv, gen-rtv) outper-form the previous state of the art (bucc) by a sig-niÔ¨Åcant margin on all language pairs.
surprisingly,rtv and gen-rtv even outperform wikimatrix byaverage f1 score, indicating that we do not needbitext supervision to obtain high-quality lexicons..7.2 automatic analysis.

in the table, rtv-1 refers to the bitext of the highest quality and rtv-5 refers to the ones of the lowest quality, in terms ofthe margin score (eq 1).14 we also add a randompseudo bitext baseline (random), where all thebitext are randomly sampled from each languagepair, as well as using all retrieved sentence pairsthat have scores larger than 1 (rtv-all)..in general, the lexicon induction performanceof rtv correlates well with the quality of bitext.
even using the bitext of the lowest quality (rtv-5),it is still able to induce reasonably good bilinguallexicon, outperforming the best numbers reportedby bucc 2020 participants (table 1) on average.
however, rtv achieves poor performance with ran-dom bitext (table 2), indicating that it is only robustto a reasonable level of noise.
while this is a lower-bound on bitext quality, even random bitext doesnot lead to 0 f1 since the model may align any.

we observe that such a trendtranslates to resulting lexicon induction perfor-mance well: a signiÔ¨Åcantly better word aligner canusually lead to a better induced lexicon..bitext quantity.
we investigate how the bliperformance changes when the quantity of bitextchanges (figure 2).
we use criss with nucleussampling (gen-n) to create different amount ofbitext of the same quality.
we Ô¨Ånd that with only1% of the bitext (160k sentence pairs on average)used by gen-n, our weakly-supervised frameworkoutperforms the previous state of the art (bucc;.

68.4.table 3: f1 scores (√ó100) on the bucc 2020 testset.
models are trained with the retrieval‚Äìbased bitext(rtv), in the weakly-supervised setting (section 4.2.the best number in each row is bolded..figure 2: f1 scores (√ó100) on the bucc 2020 testset, produced by our weakly-supervised framework us-ing different amount of bitext generated by criss withnucleus sampling.
100% is the same as gen-n in ta-ble 1. for less than 100%, we uniformly sample thecorresponding amount of bitext; for greater, we gener-ate multiple translations for each source sentence..table 1).
the model reaches its best performanceusing 20% of the bitext (3.2m sentence pairs onaverage) and then drops slightly with even more bi-text.
this is likely because more bitext introducesmore candidates word pairs..dependence on word frequency of gen vs. rtv.
we observe that retrieval-based bitext construction(rtv) works signiÔ¨Åcantly better than generation-based ones (gen and gen-n), in terms of lexiconinduction performance (table 1).
to further inves-tigate the source of such difference, we comparethe performance of the rtv and gen as a func-tion of source word frequency or target word fre-quency, where the word frequency are computedfrom the lower-cased wikipedia corpus.
in fig-ure 3, we plot the f1 of rtv and gen when themost frequent k% of words are considered.
whenall words are considered rtv outperform gen for.

results onentries with (a) the k% most frequent source words, and(b) the k% most frequent target words..11 of 12 language pairs except de-fr.
in 6 of 12language pairs, gen does better than rtv for highfrequency source words.
as more lower frequencywords are included, gen eventually does worsethan rtv.
this helps explain why the combinedmodel gen-rtv is even better since gen can havean edge in high frequency words over rtv.
thetrend that f1(rtv) ‚àí f1(gen) increases as morelower frequency words are included seems true forall language pairs (appendix a)..on average and for the majority of languagepairs, both methods do better on low-frequencysource words than high-frequency ones (figure 3a),which is consistent with the Ô¨Åndings by bucc2020 participants (rapp et al., 2020)..vecmap.
while bli through bitext construc-tion and word alignment clearly achieves superiorperformance than that through vector rotation (ta-ble 1), we further show that the gap is larger onlow-frequency words (figure 3)..7.3 ground-truth analysis.
following the advice of kementchedjhieva et al.
(2019) that some care is needed due to the in-completeness and biases of the evaluation, weperform manual analysis of selected results.
forchinese‚Äìenglish translations, we uniformly sam-ple 20 wrong lexicon entries according to the eval-uation for both gen-rtv and weakly-supervisedvecmap.
our judgments of these samples areshown in table 4. for gen-rtv, 18/20 of thesesampled errors are actually acceptable translations,whereas for vecmap, only 11/20 are acceptable.
this indicates that the improvement in quality maybe partly limited by the incompleteness of the ref-erence lexicon and the ground truth performanceof our method might be even better.

we investigatefour language pairs: german‚Äìenglish (de-en),english‚Äìfrench (en-fr), english‚Äìhindi (en-hi)and romanian‚Äìenglish (ro-en).
we Ô¨Ånd thatthe criss-based simalign already achievescompetitive performance with the state-of-the-artmethod (garg et al., 2019) which requires realbitext for training.
by ensembling the argmaxand itermax criss-based simalign results (sec-tion 5), we set the new state of the art of wordalignment without using any bitext supervision..however, by substituting the criss-basedsimalign in the bli pipeline with our aligner,we obtain an average f1 score of 73.0 for gen-rtv, which does not improve over the result of73.3 achieved by criss-based simalign (ta-ble 1), indicating that further effort is required totake the advantage of the improved word aligner..9 discussion.
we present a direct and effective framework forbli with unsupervised bitext mining and wordalignment, which sets a new state of the art on thetask.
from the perspective of pretrained multilin-gual models (conneau et al., 2019; liu et al., 2020;tran et al., 2020, inter alia), our work shows thatthey have successfully captured information aboutword translation that can be extracted using simi-larity based alignment and reÔ¨Ånement.
althoughbli is only about word types, it strongly beneÔ¨Åtsfrom contextualized reasoning at the token level..umich.edu/Àúmihalcea/wpt (en-fr and ro-en); https://web.eecs.umich.edu/Àúmihalcea/wpt05(en-hi).

the chinese sentencesare automatically converted to traditional chi-nese alphabets using chinese converter,16to keep consistent with the muse dataset..based on our knowledge about these languages,we see that the rtv-1 mostly consists of correcttranslations.
while the other sections of bitext areof less quality, sentences within a pair are highly re-lated or can be even partially aligned; therefore ourbitext mining and alignment framework can stillextract high-quality lexicon from such imperfectbitext..d results: p@1 on the muse dataset.
precision@1 (p@1) is a widely applied metric toevaluate bilingual lexicon induction (smith et al.,2017; lample et al., 2018; artetxe et al., 2019, interalia), therefore we compare our models with exist-ing approaches in terms of p@1 as well (table 9).
