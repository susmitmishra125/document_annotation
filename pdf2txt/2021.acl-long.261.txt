abstract.
the emotion cause extraction (ece) taskaimsto identify clauses which containemotion-evoking information for a particularemotion expressed in text.
we observe that awidely-used ece dataset exhibits a bias thatthe majority of annotated cause clauses are ei-ther directly before their associated emotionclauses or are the emotion clauses themselves.
existing models for ece tend to explore suchrelative position information and suffer fromthe dataset bias.
to investigate the degree ofreliance of existing ece models on clause rel-ative positions, we propose a novel strategy togenerate adversarial examples in which the rel-ative position information is no longer the in-dicative feature of cause clauses.
we test theperformance of existing models on such adver-sarial examples and observe a signiﬁcant per-formance drop.
to address the dataset bias,we propose a novel graph-based method to ex-plicitly model the emotion triggering paths byleveraging the commonsense knowledge to en-hance the semantic dependencies between acandidate clause and an emotion clause.
ex-perimental results show that our proposed ap-proach performs on par with the existing state-of-the-art methods on the original ece dataset,and is more robust against adversarial attackscompared to existing models.1.
1.introduction.
instead of detecting sentiment polarity from text,recent years have seen a surge of research activitiesthat identify the cause of emotions expressed intext (gui et al., 2017; cheng et al., 2017a; rashkinet al., 2018; xia and ding, 2019; kim and klinger,2018; oberl¨ander and klinger, 2020).
in a typi-cal dataset for emotion cause extract (ece) (gui.

et al., 2017), a document consists of multipleclauses, one of which is the emotion clause an-notated with a pre-deﬁned emotion class label.
inaddition, one or more clauses are annotated as thecause clause(s) which expresses triggering factorsleading to the emotion expressed in the emotionclause.
an emotion extraction model trained on thedataset is expected to classify a given clause as acause clause or not, given the emotion clause..figure 1: the distribution of positions of cause clausesrelative to their corresponding emotion clauses in theece dataset (gui et al., 2016).
nearly 87% of causeclauses are located near the emotion clause (about 55%are immediately preceding the emotion clause, 24% arethe emotion clauses themselves and over 7% are imme-diately after the emotion clause)..however, due to the difﬁculty in data collec-tion, the ece datasets were typically constructedby using emotion words as queries to retrieve rele-vant contexts as candidates for emotion cause an-notation, which might lead to a strong positionalbias (ding and kejriwal, 2020).
figure 1 depictsthe distribution of positions of cause clauses rela-tive to the emotion clause in the ece dataset (guiet al., 2016).
most cause clauses are either im-mediately preceding their corresponding emotionclauses or are the emotion clauses themselves.
ex-isting ece models tend to exploit such relative po-sition information and have achieved good resultson emotion cause detection.
for example, the rel-.

for example, in a recentlyreleased emotion cause dataset, only 25-27% causeclauses are located immediately before the emotionclause (poria et al., 2020).
to investigate the de-gree of reliance of existing ece models on clauserelative positions, we propose a novel strategy togenerate adversarial examples in which the relativeposition information is no longer the indicative fea-ture of cause clauses.
we test the performance ofexisting models on such adversarial examples andobserve a signiﬁcant performance drop..to alleviate the position bias problem, we pro-pose to leverage the commonsense knowledge toenhance the semantic dependencies between a can-didate clause and the emotion clause.
more con-cretely, we build a clause graph, whose node fea-tures are initialised by the clause representations,and has two types of edges i.e., sequence-edge (s-edge) and knowledge-edge (k-edge).
a s-edgelinks two consecutive clauses to capture the clauseneighbourhood information, while a k-edge linksa candidate clause with the emotion clause if thereexists a knowledge path extracted from the con-ceptnet (speer et al., 2017) between them.
weextend relation-gcns (schlichtkrull et al., 2018)to update the graph nodes by gathering informa-tion encoded in the two types of edges.
finally,the cause clause is detected by performing node(i.e., clause) classiﬁcation on the clause graph.
insummary, our contributions are three-fold:.
• we investigate the bias in the emotion causeextraction (ece) dataset and propose a novelstrategy to generate adversarial examples inwhich the position of a candidate clause rel-ative to the emotion clause is no longer theindicative feature for cause extraction..• we develop a new emotion cause extractionapproach built on clause graphs in whichnodes are clauses and edges linking two nodescapture the neighbourhood information as.
well as the implicit reasoning paths extractedfrom a commonsense knowledge base be-tween clauses.
node representations are up-dated using the extended relation-gcn.
• experimental results show that our proposedapproach performs on par with the existingstate-of-the-art methods on the original ecedataset, and is more robust when evaluatingon the adversarial examples..2 related work.
the presented work is closely related to two linesof research in emotion cause extraction: position-insensitive and position-aware models.
position-insensitive models.
a more traditionalline of research exploited structural representationsof textual units relying on rule-based systems (leeet al., 2010) or incorporated commonsense knowl-edge bases (gao et al., 2015) for emotion cause ex-traction.
machine learning methods leveraged textfeatures (gui et al., 2017) and combined them withmulti-kernel support vector machine (svm) (xuet al., 2017).
more recent works developed neu-ral architectures to generate effective semantic fea-tures.
cheng et al.
(2017b) employed lstm mod-els, gui et al.
(2017) made use of memory net-works, while li et al.
(2018) devised a convolu-tional neural network (cnn) with a co-attentionmechanism.
(chen et al., 2018) used the emo-tion classiﬁcation task to enhance cause extractionresults.
position-aware models.
more recent methodolo-gies have started to explicitly leverage the positionsof cause clauses with respect to the emotion clause.
a common strategy is to concatenate the clause rel-ative position embedding with the candidate clauserepresentation (ding et al., 2019; xia et al., 2019;li et al., 2019).
the relative position augmentedwith dynamic global labels (pae-dgl) (dinget al., 2019) reordered clauses based on their dis-tances from the target emotion clause, and propa-gated the information of surrounding clauses to theothers.
xu et al.
(2019) used emotion dependentand independent features to rank clauses and iden-tify the cause.
the rnn-transformer hierarchicalnetwork (rthn) (xia et al., 2019) argued there ex-ist relations between clauses in a document and pro-posed to classify multiple clauses simultaneously.
li et al.
(2019) proposed a multi-attention-basedneural network (mann) to model the interactionsbetween a candidate clause and the emotion clause..3365figure 2: the framework of our proposed kag.
given an input document consisting of eight clauses (c1 · · · c8),we ﬁrst extract knowledge paths from conceptnet between each candidate clause and the emotion clause (§3.1),e.g., two knowledge paths, p1 and p2, are extracted between c1 and the emotion clause c5.
(a) document encod-ing.
clauses are fed into a word-level bi-lstm and a clause-level transformer to obtain the clause representationsˆci.
the document embedding d is generated by dot-attention between the emotion embedding ˆce and clauseembeddings.
(b) path representations.
the extracted knowledge paths are fed into bi-lstm to derive path rep-resentations.
multiple paths between a clause pair are aggregated into si based on their attention to the documentrepresentation d. (c) clause graph update.
a clause graph is built with the clause representations ˆci used toinitialise the graph nodes.
the k-edge weight eie between a candidate clause ˆci and the emotion clause ˆce aremeasured by their distance along their path si.
(d) classiﬁcation.
node representation hi of a candidate clauseci is concatenated with the emotion node representation he, and then fed to a softmax layer to yield the clauseclassiﬁcation result ˆyi..the generated representations are fed to a cnnlayer for emotion cause extraction.
the hierar-chical neural network (fan et al., 2019) aimed atnarrowing the gap between the prediction distribu-tion p and the true distribution of the cause clauserelative positions..3 knowledge-aware graph (kag).
model for emotion cause extraction.
we ﬁrst deﬁne the emotion cause extraction (ece)task here.
a document d contains n clauses d ={ci}ni=1, one of which is annotated as an emotionclause ce with a pre-deﬁned emotion class label,ew.
the ece task is to identify one or more causeclauses, ct, 1 ≤ t ≤ n , that trigger the emotionexpressed in ce.
note that the emotion clauseitself can be a cause clause..we propose a knowledge-aware graph (kag)model as shown in figure 2, which incorporatesknowledge paths extracted from conceptnet foremotion cause extraction.
more concretely, foreach document, a graph is ﬁrst constructed by rep-resenting each clause in the document as a node.
the edge linking two nodes captures the sequen-tial relation between neighbouring clauses (calledthe sequence edge or s-edge).
in addition, to bet-.
ter capture the semantic relation between a can-didate clause and the emotion clause, we identifykeywords in the candidate clause which can reachthe annotated emotion class label by following theknowledge paths in the conceptnet.
the extractedknowledge paths from conceptnet are used to en-rich the relationship between the candidate clauseand the emotion clause and are inserted into theclause graph as the knowledge edge or k-edge.
we argue that by adding the k-edges, we can bettermodel the semantic relations between a candidateclause and the emotion clause, regardless of theirrelative positional distance..in what follows, we will ﬁrst describe how toextract knowledge paths from conceptnet, thenpresent the incorporation of the knowledge pathsinto context modelling, and ﬁnally discuss the useof graphical convolutional network (gcn) forlearning node (or clause) representations and theprediction of the cause clause based on the learnednode representations..3.1 knowledge path extraction from.

words in red are identiﬁed keywords.
‘happiness’ is the emotion label of the emotion clause c5.
for bettervisualization, we only display two extracted knowledge paths between ‘adopt’ and ‘happiness’ in the conceptnet..lation between a candidate clause and the emotionclause, we propose to extract cause-related pathslinking a word in the candidate clause with the an-notated emotion word or the emotion class label,ew, in the emotion clause.
more concretely, for acandidate clause, we ﬁrst perform word segmenta-tion using the chinese segmentation tool, jieba2,and then extract the top three keywords ranked bytext-rank3.
based on the ﬁndings in (fan et al.,2019) that sentiment descriptions can be relevantto the emotion cause, we also include adjectives inthe keywords set..we regard each keyword in a candidate clauseas a head entity, eh, and the emotion word or theemotion class label in the emotion clause as the tailentity, et.
similar to (lin et al., 2019), we applynetworkx4 to perform a depth-ﬁrst search on theconceptnet to identify the paths which start fromeh and end at et, and only keep the paths whichcontain less than two intermediate entities.
thisis because shorter paths are more likely to offerreliable reasoning evidence (xiong et al., 2017).
since not all relations in conceptnet are relatedto or indicative of causal relations, we further re-move the paths which contain any of these fourrelations: ‘antonym’, ‘distinct from’, ‘not desires’,and ‘not capable of ’.
finally, we order paths bytheir lengths in an ascending order and choosethe top k paths as the result for each candidate-emotion clause pair5..an example is shown in figure 3. the 5-th.
2https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba3we have also experimented with other keyword extractionstrategies, such as extracting words with higher tfidf valuesor keeping all words after removing the stop words.
but wedid not observe improved emotion cause detection results..4http://networkx.github.io/5we set k to 15, which is the median of the number ofpaths between all the candidate-emotion clause pairs in ourdataset..clause is annotated as the emotion clause and theemotion class label is ‘happiness’.
for the key-word, ‘adopted’, in the ﬁrst clause, we show twoexample paths extracted from conceptnet, each ofwhich links the word ‘adopted’ with ‘happiness’.
one such a path is “adopted −related to→ ac-ceptance −has subevent→ make better world−causes→ happiness”..3.2 knowledge-aware graph (kag) model.
as shown in figure 2, there are four componentsin our model: a document encoding module, acontext-aware path representation learning module,a gcn-based graph representation updating mod-ule, and ﬁnally a softmax layer for cause clauseclassiﬁcation..initial clause/document representation learn-ing for each clause ci, we derive its represen-tation, ci, by using a bi-lstm operating on itsconstituent word vectors, where each word vectorwi ∈ rd is obtained via an embedding layer.
tocapture the sequential relationship (s-edges) be-tween neighbouring clauses in a document, we feedthe clause sequence into a transformer architecture.
similar to the original transformer incorporatingthe position embedding with the word embedding,we utilise the clause position information to enrichthe clause representation.
here, the position em-bedding oi of each clause is concatenated with itsrepresentation ci generated by bi-lstm..ˆci = transformer(ci || oi).
(1).
we consider different ways for encoding positionembeddings using either relative or absolute clausepositions and explore their differences in the exper-iments section.
in addition, we will also show theresults without using position embeddings at all..3367bai jinyue, an ordinary worker in xingtai steel factory in hebei province  and the department leader replied to my mailwhen i found that my advice had been adoptedi realized that i had made contributions to the country's developmenttalked to the journalist with exicitmentdifferent departments, like the public security, have accepted his advice with a thank you letter in his handsc2)c4)c3)c6)c7)c8)since 27 years agoacceptanceculture diffusionspreadc1)c5)make better worldhappinessconceptnetsince the aim of our task is to identify the causeclause given an emotion clause, we capture thedependencies between each candidate clause andthe emotion clause.
therefore, in the documentcontext modelling, we consider the emotion clauseˆce, generated in a similar way as ˆci, as the queryvector, and the candidate clause representation ˆcias both the key and value vectors, in order to derivethe document representation, d ∈ rd..context-aware path representation in sec-tion 3.1, we have chosen a maximum of k paths{pt}kt=1 linking each candidate ci with the emo-tion clause.
however, not every path correlatesequally to the document context.
taking the docu-ment shown in figure 3 as an example, the purpleknowledge path is more closely related to the docu-ment context compared to the green path.
as such,we should assign a higher weight to the purplepath than the green one.
we propose to use thedocument-level representation d obtained aboveas the query vector, and a knowledge path as bothkey and value vectors, in order to calculate thesimilarity between the knowledge path and thedocument context.
for each pair of a candidateclause ci and the emotion clause, we then aggre-gate the k knowledge paths to derive the context-aware path representation si ∈ rd below:.
si =.

(2).
where d is the document representation, pt is thepath representation obtained from bi-lstm on apath expressed as an entity-relation word sequence..update of clause representations by gcnafter constructing a clause graph such as the oneshown in figure 2(c), we update the clause/noderepresentations via s-edges and k-edges.
onlyclauses with valid knowledge paths to the emotionclause are connected with the emotion clause node.
after initialising the node (or clause) in theclause graph with ˆci and the extracted knowledgepath with si, we update clause representation us-ing an extended version of gcn, i.e.
relation-gcns (aka.
r-gcns) (schlichtkrull et al., 2018),which is designed for information aggregation overmultiple different edges:.

r ∈ rd×d is relation-speciﬁc, nithe (cid:96)-th layer, w (cid:96)is the set of neighbouring nodes of the i-th node,rnj is the set of distinct edges linking the currentnode and its neighbouring nodes..when aggregating the neighbouring nodes in-formation along the k-edge, we leverage the pathrepresentation si to measure the node importance.
this idea is inspired by the translation-based mod-els in graph embedding methods (bordes et al.,2013).
here, if a clause pair contains a possiblereasoning process described by the k-edge, thenˆhe ≈ ˆhi + si holds.
otherwise, ˆhi + si shouldbe far away from the emotion clause representationˆhe.6 therefore, we measure the importance ofgraph nodes according to the similarity between(hi + si) and he.
here, we use the scaled dot-attention to calculate the similarity eie and obtainthe updated node representation zi..zi = softmax(ee)h(cid:96).

table 1: results of different models on the ece dataset.
our model achieves the best precision and f1 score..dataset and evaluation metrics the evalua-tion dataset (gui et al., 2016) consists of 2,105 doc-uments from sina city news.
as the dataset size isnot large, we perform 10-fold cross-validation andreport results on three standard metrics, i.e.
preci-sion (p), recall (r), and f1-measure, all evaluatedat the clause level..baselines we compare our model with theposition-insensitive and position-aware baselines:rb (lee et al., 2010) and emocause (russo et al.,2011) are rules-based methods.
multi-kernel (guiet al., 2016) and ngrams+svm (xu et al., 2017)leverage support vector machines via differenttextual feature to train emotion cause classiﬁers.
cnn (kim, 2014) and cann (li et al., 2018) arevanilla or attention-enhanced approaches.
mem-net (gui et al., 2017) uses a deep memory net-work to re-frame ece as a question-answeringtask.
position-aware models use the relative po-sition embedding to enhance the semantic features.
hcs (yu et al., 2019) uses separate hierarchicaland attention module to obtain context and informa-tion.
besides that, pae-dgl (ding et al., 2019)and rthn (xia et al., 2019) use similar globalprediction embedding (gpe) to twist the clauses’ﬁrst-round predictions.
mann (li et al., 2019)performs multi-head attention in cnn to jointlyencode the emotion and candidate clauses.
lamb-damart (xu et al., 2019) uses the relative posi-tion, word-embedding similarity and topic similar-ity as emotion-related feature to extract cause..table 1 shows the cause clause classiﬁcation re-sults on the ece dataset.
two rule-based meth-ods have poor performances, possibly due to theirpre-deﬁned rules.
multi-kernel performs betterthan the vanilla svm, being able to leverage morecontextual information.
across the other threegroups, the precision scores are higher than recallscores, and it is probably due to the unbalancednumber of cause clauses (18.36%) and non-causeclauses (81.64%), leading the models to predict aclause as non-cause more often..models in the position-aware group perform bet-ter than those in the other groups, indicating theimportance of position information.
our proposedmodel outperforms all the other models exceptrhnn in which its recall score is slightly lower.
we have also performed ablation studies by remov-ing either k-edge or s-edge, or both of them (w/or-gcns).
the results show that removing the r-gcns leads to a drop of nearly 4.3% in f1.
also,both the k-edge and s-edge contributes to emo-tion cause extraction.
as contextual modelling hasconsidered the position information, the removalof s-edge leads to a smaller drop compared to theremoval of k-edge..4.2.impact of encoding clause positioninformation.
in order to examine the impact of using the clauseposition information in different models, we re-place the relative position information of the candi-date clause with absolute positions.
in the extremecase, we remove the position information from themodels.
the results are shown in figure 4. it canbe observed that the best results are achieved usingrelative positions for all models.
replacing relativepositions using either absolution positions or noposition at all results in a signiﬁcant performancedrop.
in particular, mann and pae-dgl haveover 50-54% drop in f1.
the performance degra-dation is less signiﬁcant for rthn, partly due toits use of the transformer architecture for contextmodeling.
nevertheless, we have observed a de-crease in f1 score in the range of 20-35%.
ourproposed model is less sensitive to the relative po-sitions of candidate clauses.
its robust performancepartly attributes to the use of (1) hierarchical con-textual modeling via the transformer structure, and(2) the k-egde which helps explore causal links viacommonsense knowledge regardless of a clause’s.
3369to locate the least likely cause clause, we pro-pose to choose the value for r2 according to theattention score between a candidate clause and theemotion clause.
our intuition is that if the emotionclause has a lower score attended to a candidateclause, then it is less likely to be the cause clause.
we use an existing emotion cause extraction modelto generate contextual representations and use thedot-attention (luong et al., 2015) to measure thesimilarity between each candidate clause and theemotion clause.
we then select the index i whichgives the lowest attention score and assign it to r2:.
r2 = arg min.

we use leave-one-model-out to evaluate the perfor-mance of ece models.
in particular, one model isused as a discriminator for generating adversarialsamples which are subsequently used to evaluatethe performance of other models..results the results are shown in table 2. theattacked ece models are merely trained on theoriginal dataset.
the generated adversarial exam-ples are used as the test set only.
we can observea signiﬁcant performance drop of 23-32% for theexisting ece models, some of which even performworse than the earlier rule-based methods, showingtheir sensitivity to the positional bias in the dataset.
we also observe the performance degradation ofour proposed kag.
but its performance drop is lesssigniﬁcant compared to other models.
the resultsverify the effectiveness of capturing the semanticdependencies between a candidate clause and theemotion clause via contextual and commonsenseknowledge encoding..4.4 case study and error analysis.
to understand how kag aggregate informationbased on different paths, we randomly choosetwo examples to visualise the attention distribu-tions (eq.

in recent years, there have been growing inter-ests in understanding vulnerabilities of nlp sys-tems (goodfellow et al., 2015; ebrahimi et al.,2017; wallace et al., 2019; jin et al., 2020).
adver-sarial examples explore regions where the modelperforms poorly, which could help understandingand improving the model.
our purpose here is toevaluate if kag is vulnerable as existing ece mod-els when the cause clauses are not in proximity tothe emotion clause.therefore, we propose a prin-cipled way to generate adversarial samples suchthat the relative position is no longer an indicativefeature for the ece task..generation of adversarial examples we gen-erate adversarial examples to trick ece models,which relies on swapping two clauses cr1 and cr2,where r1 denotes the position of the most likelycause clause, while r2 denotes the position of theleast likely cause clause..we identify r1 by locating the most likely causeclause based on its relative position with respect tothe emotion clause in a document.
as illustratedin figure 1, over half of the cause clauses are im-mediately before the emotion clause in the dataset.
we assume that the position of a cause clause canbe modelled by a gaussian distribution and esti-mate the mean and variance directly from the data,which are, {µ, σ2} = {−1, 0.5445}.
the positionindex r1 can then be sampled from the gaussiandistribution.
as the sampled value is continuous,we round the value to its nearest integer:.

thelisted four ece models are attacked by the adversar-ial samples generated from the respective discriminator.
our model shows the minimal drop rate comparing toother listed ece models across all sets of adversarialsamples..in figure 5.9 these attention weights show the ‘dis-tance’ between a candidate clause and the emotionclause during the reasoning process.
the causeclauses are underlined, and keywords are in bold.
ci in brackets indicate the relative clause positionto the emotion clause (which is denoted as c0)..ex.1 the crime that ten people were killed shocked thewhole country (c−4).
this was due to personal grievances(c−3).
qiu had arguments with the management staff (c−2),and thought the taoist temple host had molested his wife(c−1).
he became angry (c0), and killed the host and de-stroyed the temple (c1)..in ex.1, the emotion word is ‘angry’, the knowl-edge path identiﬁed by our model from conceptnetis, “arguments → ﬁght →angry” for clause c−2,and “molest → irritate →exasperate→angry” forclause c−1.
our model assigns the same attentionweight to the clauses c−2, c−1 and the emotionclause, as shown in figure 5. this shows that bothpaths are equally weighted by our model.
due tothe k-edge attention weights, our model can cor-rectly identify both c−2 and c−1 clauses as thecause clauses..ex.2 the longbao primary school locates between the twovillages (c−2).
some unemployed people always cut throughthe school to take a shortcut (c−1).
liu yurong worried thatit would affect children’s study (c0).
when he did not haveteaching duties (c1), he stood guard outside the school gate(c2)..in ex.2, the path identiﬁed by our model fromconceptnet for clause (c−1) is “unemployment→ situation → trouble/danger→ worried”.
it has.
9more cases can be found in the appendix..been assigned the largest attention weight as shownin figure 5. note that the path identiﬁed is spurioussince the emotion of ‘worried’ is triggered by ‘un-employment’ in the conceptnet, while in the origi-nal text, ‘worried’ is caused by the event, ‘unem-ployed people cut through the school’.
this showsthat simply using keywords or entities searching forknowledge paths from commonsense knowledgebases may lead to spurious knowledge extracted.
we will leave the extraction of event-driven com-monsense knowledge as future work..figure 5: attention weights among different graphnodes/clauses on ex.1 and ex.2..5 conclusion and future work.
in this paper, we examine the positional bias in theannotated ece dataset and investigate the degreeof reliance of the clause position information inexisting ece models.
we design a novel approachfor generating adversarial samples.
moreover, wepropose a graph-based model to enhance the seman-tic dependencies between a candidate clause and agiven emotion clause by extracting relevant knowl-edge paths from conceptnet.
the experimental re-sults show that our proposed method achieves com-parative performance to the state-of-the-art meth-ods, and is more robust against adversarial attacks.
our current model extracts knowledge paths link-ing two keywords identiﬁed in two separate clauses.
in the future, we will exploit how to incorporate theevent-level commonsense knowledge to improvethe performance of emotion cause extraction..acknowledgements.

in this section, we describe the details of the fourmain components in our model: contextual mod-elling, knowledge path encoding, clause graph up-date and cause clause classiﬁcation..the dataset has 2,105 documents.
the maximumnumber of clauses in a document is 75 and themaximum number of words per clause is 45. so weﬁrst pad the input documents into a matrix i withthe shape of [2105, 75, 45]..a.1 contextual modelling.
a. token → clause we ﬁrst apply a 1-layer bi-lstm of 100 hidden units to obtain word embed-dings, w ∈ r200.
we then use two linear transfor-mation layers (hidden units are [200,200],[200,1])to map the original w to a scalar attention score α,then perform a weighted aggregation to generatethe clause representation ˆci ∈ r200.
b. clause → document we feed the clause repre-sentations into a transformer.
it has 3 stackedblocks, with the multi-head number set to 5, andthe dimension of key, value, query is all set to 200.the query vector is the emotion clause representa-tion ˆce ∈ r200, the key and value representationsare candidate clause representations, also with 200dimensions.
finally, the updated clause representa-tions are aggregated via dot-attention to generatethe document representation d ∈ r200..a.2 knowledge path encoding.
for each candidate clause and the emotion clause,we extract knowledge paths from conceptnet andonly select k paths.
the values of k is set to 15,since the median of the number of paths betweena candidate clause and the emotion clause is 15 inour dataset..we use the same bi-lstm described in sectiona.1 to encode each knowledge path and generatethe k number of path representations {pit}kt=1 be-tween the i-th clause and the emotion clause.
then,the document representation d is applied as thequery to attend to each path in {pit} to generate theﬁnal context-aware path representation si ∈ r200..the non-linear functions are independent selu lay-ers..a.4 cause clause classiﬁcation.
the mlp with [400,1] hidden units takes the con-catenation of each candidate node {hli }ni=1 and theemotion node representation hle to predict the logit,after which, a softmax layer is applied to predictthe probability of the cause clause..b training details for kag.
we randomly split the datasets into 9:1 (train/test).
for each split, we run 50 iterations to get the bestmodel on the validation set, which takes an averagetime of around 23 minutes per split, when con-ducted on a nvidia gtx 1080ti.
for each split,we test the model on the test set at the end of eachiteration and keep the best resulting f1 of the split.
the number of model parameters is 1,133,002..hyper-parameter search we use the gridsearch to ﬁnd the best parameters for our modelon the validation data, and report in the follow-ing the hyper-parameter values providing the bestperformance..• the word embeddings used to initialise thebi-lstm is provided by nlpcc10.
it waspre-trained on a 1.1 million chinese weibocorpora following the word2vec algorithm.
the word embedding dimension is set to 200..• the position embedding dimension is set to50, randomly initialised with the uniform dis-tribution (-0.1,0.1)..• the number of transformer blocks is 2 and.
the number of graph layers is 3..• to regularise against over-ﬁtting, we employdropout (0.5 in the encoder, 0.2 in the graphlayer)..• the network is trained using the the adam op-timiser with a mini-batch size 64 and a learn-ing rate η = 0.005. the parameters of ourmodel are initialised with glorot initialisation..a.3 clause graph update.
c error analysis.
the graph nodes are initialised by clause presenta-tions, with the feature dimension 200. to calculatethe attention weights eie in r-gcns, we use thenon-linearly transformed hi + si as the query, thenon-linearly transformed he as the value and key..we perform error analysis to identify the limitationsof the proposed model.
in the following examples(ex.1 and ex.2), the cause clauses are in bold, ourpredictions are underlined..10https://github.com/nustm/rthn/tree/master/data.
33740.79, while annotator 2 achieved 0.938 agreementwith the cohen’s kappa value of 0.72. this alignswith our intuition that an emotion expressed in textis triggered by a certain event, rather than deter-mined by relative clause positions.
a good ecemodel should be able to learn a correlation betweenan event and its associated emotion.
this also mo-tivates our proposal of a knowledge-aware modelwhich leverages commonsense knowledge to ex-plicitly capture event-emotion relationships..ex.1 some kind people said (c−6), if wu xiaolicould ﬁnd available kidneys (c−5), they wouldlike to donate for her surgery (c−4).
4000rmbdonation had been sent to xiaoli (c−3), qiu huasaid (c−2).
the child’s desire to survival shockedus (c−1).
the family’s companion was touch-ing (c0).
wish kind people will be ready to givea helping hand (c1).
help the family in difﬁculty(c2)..in the ﬁrst example ex.1, our model identiﬁesthe keyword survival in c−1 and extracts severalpaths from ‘survival’ to ‘touching’.
however, themain event in clause c−1 concerns desire ratherthan survival.
our current model detects the emo-tion reasoning process from conceptnet based onkeywords identiﬁed in text, and inevitably intro-duces spurious knowledge paths to model learning..i have only one daughter (c0), and a grand-ex.2daughter of 8 year-old (c−10).
i would like toconvey these memory to her (c−9).
last springfestival (c−8), i gave the dvd away to my grand-daughter (c−7).
i hope she can inherit my memory(c−6).
thus (c−5), i feel like that my ages becomeeternity (c−4).
sun qing said (c−3).
his father isa sensitive and has great passion for his life (c−2).
he did so (c−1).
making me feel touched (c0).
his daughter said (c1)..in the ex 2, our model detected the passion as akeyword and extracted knowledge paths betweenthe clause c−2 and the emotion clause.
however,it ignores the semantic dependency between theclause c−1 and the emotion clause.
it is thereforemore desirable to consider semantic dependenciesor discourse relations between clauses/sentencesfor emotion reasoning path extraction from externalcommonsense knowledge sources..d human evaluation on the generated.
adversarial samples.
the way adversarial examples generated changesthe order of the original document clauses.
there-fore, we would like to ﬁnd out if such clause re-ordering changes the original semantic meaningand if these adversarial samples can be used toevaluate on the same emotion cause labels..we randomly selected 100 adversarial examplesand ask two independent annotators to manuallyannotate emotion cause clauses based on the sameannotation scheme of the ece dataset.
comparedto the original annotations, annotator 1 achieved0.954 agreement with the cohen’s kappa value of.
