abstract.
the effectiveness of neural information re-trieval (neu-ir) often depends on a large scaleof in-domain relevance training signals, whichare not always available in real-world rankingscenarios.
to democratize the beneﬁts of neu-ir, this paper presents metaadaptrank, a do-main adaptive learning method that general-izes neu-ir models from label-rich source do-mains to few-shot target domains.
drawing onsource-domain massive relevance supervision,metaadaptrank contrastively synthesizes alarge number of weak supervision signals fortarget domains and meta-learns to reweightthese synthetic “weak” data based on their ben-eﬁts to the target-domain ranking accuracy ofneu-ir models.
experiments on three trecbenchmarks in the web, news, and biomed-ical domains show that metaadaptrank sig-niﬁcantly improves the few-shot ranking accu-racy of neu-ir models.
further analyses in-dicate that metaadaptrank thrives from bothits contrastive weak data synthesis and meta-reweighted data selection.

text retrieval aims to rank documents to either di-rectly satisfy users’ search needs or ﬁnd textualinformation for later processing components, e.g.,question answering (chen et al., 2017) and factveriﬁcation (liu et al., 2020).
neural informationretrieval (neu-ir) models have recently shown ad-vanced results in many ranking scenarios wheremassive relevance labels or clickthrough data areavailable (mitra et al., 2018; craswell et al., 2020).
the ﬂip side is that the “data-hungry” nature ofneu-ir models yields mixed results in few-shotranking scenarios that suffer from the shortage oflabeled data and implicit user feedback (lin, 2019;yang et al., 2019).
on ranking benchmarks with.
only hundreds of labeled queries, there have beendebates about whether neu-ir, even with billionsof pre-trained parameters (zhang et al., 2020a), re-ally outperforms traditional ir techniques such asfeature-based models and latent semantic index-ing (yang et al., 2019; roberts et al., 2020).
infact, many real-world ranking scenarios are few-shot, e.g., tail web queries that innately lack largesupervision (downey et al., 2007), applicationswith strong privacy constraints like personal andenterprise search (chirita et al., 2005; hawking,2004), and domains where labeling requires pro-fessional expertise such as biomedical and legalsearch (roberts et al., 2020; arora et al., 2018)..to broaden the beneﬁts of neu-ir to few-shotscenarios, we present an adaptive learning methodmetaadaptrank that meta-learns to adapt neu-irmodels to target domains with synthetic weak su-pervision.
for synthesizing weak supervision, wetake inspiration from the work (ma et al., 2021) thatgenerates related queries for unlabeled documentsin a zero-shot way, but we generate discriminativequeries based on contrastive pairs of relevant (posi-tive) and irrelevant (negative) documents.
by intro-ducing the negative contrast, metaadaptrank cansubtly capture the difference between documentsto synthesize more ranking-aware weak supervi-sion signals.
given that synthetic weak supervisioninevitably contains noises, metaadaptrank meta-learns to reweight these synthetic weak data andtrains neu-ir models to achieve the best accuracyon a small volume of target data.
in this way, neuralrankers can distinguish more useful synthetic weaksupervision based on the similarity of the gradientdirections of synthetic data and target data (renet al., 2018) instead of manual heuristics or trial-and-error data selection (zhang et al., 2020b)..we conduct experiments on three trec bench-marks, clueweb09, robust04, and trec-covid,which come from the web, news, and biomedi-.

metaadaptrank signiﬁ-cantly improves the few-shot ranking accuracy ofneu-ir models across all benchmarks.
we alsoempirically indicate that both contrastive weakdata synthesis and meta-reweighted data selec-tion contribute to metaadaptrank’s effectiveness.
compared to prior work (ma et al., 2021; zhanget al., 2020b), metaadaptrank not only synthe-sizes more informative queries and effective weakrelevance signals but customizes more diverse andﬁne-grained weights on synthetic weak data to bet-ter adapt neural rankers to target few-shot domains..2 related work.
recent neu-ir methods have achieved promisingresults in modeling relevance matching patterns be-tween queries and documents (guo et al., 2016; huiet al., 2017; mitra et al., 2018).
they have been ex-tensively employed in ad-hoc text retrieval (xionget al., 2017b; dai et al., 2018; nogueira and cho,2019; xiong et al., 2021) and later natural languageprocessing (nlp) tasks (lee et al., 2019; liu et al.,2020; qu et al., 2020)..the effectiveness of neu-ir methods heavilyrelies on the end-to-end training with a large num-ber of relevance supervision signals, e.g., relevancelabels or user clicks.
nevertheless, such supervi-sion signals are often insufﬁcient in many rankingscenarios.
the less availability of relevance super-vision pushes some neu-ir methods to freeze theirembeddings to avoid overﬁtting (yates et al., 2020).
the powerful deep pre-trained language models,such as bert (devlin et al., 2019), also do noteffectively alleviate the dependence of neu-ir ona large scale of relevance training signals.
recentresearch even observes that bert-based neuralrankers might require more training data than shal-low neural ranking models (hofst¨atter et al., 2020;craswell et al., 2020).
moreover, they may often beoverly conﬁdent and more unstable in the learningprocess (qiao et al., 2019)..a promising direction to alleviate the depen-dence of neu-ir models on large-scale relevancesupervision is to leverage weak supervision signalsthat are noisy but available at mass quantity (zhenget al., 2019b; dehghani et al., 2017; yu et al.,2020).
through ir history, various weak supervi-sion sources have been used to approximate query-document relevance signals, e.g., pseudo relevancelabels generated by unsupervised retrieval meth-ods (dehghani et al., 2017; zheng et al., 2019b),.
and title-document pairs (macavaney et al., 2019).
recently, zhang et al.
(2020b) treat paired anchortexts and linked pages as weak relevance signalsand propose a reinforcement-based data selectionmethod reinfoselect, which learns to ﬁlter noisyanchor signals with trial-and-error policy gradients.
despite their convincing results, anchor signals areonly available in web domains.
directly applyingthem to non-web domains may suffer from subopti-mal outcomes due to domain gaps.
to obtain weaksupervision that adapts arbitrary domains, ma et al.
(2021) present a synthetic query generation method,which can be trained with source-domain relevancesignals and applied on target-domain documents togenerate related queries..more recently, a novel meta-learning techniquehas shown encouraging progress on solving datanoises and label biases in computer vision (renet al., 2018; shu et al., 2019; zheng et al., 2019a)and some nlp tasks (zheng et al., 2019a; wanget al., 2020b).
to the best of our knowledge, thisnovel technique has not been well utilized in infor-mation retrieval and synthetic supervision settings..3 methodology.
this section ﬁrst recaps the preliminary of neu-irand then introduces our proposed metaadaptrank.
the framework of our method is shown in figure 1..3.1 preliminary of neu-ir.
the ad-hoc retrieval task is to calculate a rankingscore f (q, d; θ) for a query q and a document dfrom a document set.
in neu-ir, the ranking scoref (·; θ) is calculated by a neural model, e.g., bert,with parameters θ. the query q and the documentd are encoded to the token-level representations h:.
h = bert([cls] ◦ q ◦ [sep] ◦ d ◦ [sep]),.
(1).
where ◦ represents the concatenation operation.
[cls] and [sep] are special tokens.
the ﬁrst token(“[cls]”) representation h0 is regarded as the rep-resentation of the q-d pair.
then the ranking scoref (q, d; θ) of the pair can be calculated as:.
f (q, d; θ) = tanh(linear(h0))..(2).
the standard learning to rank loss li(θ) (liu,2009), e.g., pairwise loss, can be used to optimizethe neural model with relevance supervision signals{(qi, d+.
i ), 1 ≤ i ≤ m }:.
i , d−.
li(θ) = relu(1 − (f (qi, d+.
i ; θ) − f (qi, d−.
i ; θ))),.
(3).

where d+i denote the relevant (positive)and irrelevant (negative) documents of the query qi.
in few-shot ranking scenarios, the number of rele-vance supervision signals (m ) is limited, makingit difﬁcult to train an accurate neu-ir model..to mitigate the few-shot challenge in neu-ir,metaadaptrank ﬁrst transfers source-domain su-pervision signals to target-domain weak supervi-sion signals (sec 3.2); then meta-learns to reweightthe synthetic weak supervision (sec 3.3) for selec-tively training neu-ir models (sec 3.4)..3.2 contrastive synthetic supervision.
metaadaptrank transfers the relevance supervi-sion signals from source domains to few-shot targetdomains in a zero-shot way.
in this way, a naturallanguage generation (nlg) model is trained onsource domain relevance signals (source-domainnlg training) and is employed in target domainsto synthesize weak supervision signals (target-domain nlg inference).
we will ﬁrst recap theprevious synthetic method (ma et al., 2021) andthen introduce our contrastive synthetic approach.
preliminary of synthetic supervision.
givena large volume of source-domain relevance pairs(q, d+), previous synthetic method (ma et al., 2021)trains a nlg model such as t5 (raffel et al., 2020)that learns to generate a query q based on its rele-vant document d+:.
q = t5-nlg([pos] ◦ d+ ◦ [sep]),.
(4).
where [pos] and [sep] are special tokens.
in infer-ence, the trained query generator is directly usedto generate new queries q∗ for target-domain docu-ments d∗, where d∗ is regarded as the related (posi-.
tive) document of q∗, while the unrelated (negative)document can be sampled from the target corpus.
despite some promising results, the vanilla train-ing strategy may cause the nlg model to prefer togenerate broad and general queries that are likelyrelated to a crowd of documents in the target corpus.
as a consequence, the synthetic relevance super-vision does not have enough ranking awareness totrain robust neu-ir models..source-domain nlg training.
to synthesizeranking-aware weak supervision, metaadaptranktrains the nlg model to capture the differencebetween the contrastive document pair (d+, d−)and generate a discriminative query q:.
q = t5-nlg([pos] ◦ d+ ◦ [neg] ◦ d− ◦ [sep]),.
(5).
where [neg] is another special token.
the traininginstances (q, d+, d−) can be obtained from sourcedomains in which d+ and d− are annotated as therelevant and irrelevant documents for the query q.target-domain nlg inference.
during infer-ence, we ﬁrst pick out a mass of confusable docu-ment pairs from target domains and then feed theminto our trained contrastive query generator (eq.
5)to synthesize more valuable weak supervision data.
to get confusable document pairs, we ﬁrst gen-erate a seed query q∗ for each target-domain docu-ment d∗ using the trained query generator (eq.
4).
then the seed query is used to retrieve a subset ofdocuments with bm25, where other retrieval meth-ods can also be utilized.
the confusable documentpairs (d+(cid:48), d−(cid:48)) are pairwise sampled from the re-trieved subset without considering their rankings.
given the confusable document pair, we leverageour trained contrastive query generator to generate.

inthis way, we can synthesize massive target-domain(cid:48), d+weak supervision {(qjj.

3.3 meta learning to reweight.
the synthetic weak data inevitably contain noises.
to distinguish more useful training data for neuralrankers, metaadaptrank meta-learns to reweightthese synthetic data, following ren et al.
(2018)..(cid:48), d+j.

given a large vol-(cid:48)), 1 ≤ j ≤ume of synthetic data {(qjn } and a handful of target data {(qi, d+i , d−i ), 1 ≤i ≤ m } (m (cid:28) n ), our meta-learning objectiveis to ﬁnd the optimal weights w∗ on synthetic datato better train neural rankers.
the learning of w∗involves two nested loops of optimization: initial-weighted synthetic data is used to pseudo-optimizethe neural ranker; the weights is then optimized byminimizing the neural ranking loss on target data.
to be speciﬁc, the ﬁrst loop (meta-forward up-date) incorporates the initial weights w into thelearning parameters (cid:101)θ(w) instead of truly optimiz-ing the neural ranker:.
where α is the learning rate.

we leverage the neu-ral ranker (cid:101)θt+1(w) to calculate the ranking loss onthe target data batch and obtain the optimal weightsw∗ = {w∗j=1 through a single optimization step:.

in each training step, metaadaptrank ﬁrst learnsto reweight the synthetic batch based on their meta-impact on the target batch and then updates the neu-ral ranker with the weighted synthetic batch.
in thisway, the few-shot target data can serve more as a“regularizer” to help the neural ranker to generalizewith synthetic data, instead of as direct supervisionwhich requires more labels (ren et al., 2018)..(cid:101)θ(w) = arg min.

and implementation details..datasets.
as shown in table 1, three standardtrec datasets with different domains are usedin our experiments: clueweb09-b (callan et al.,2009), robust04 (kwok et al., 2004), and trec-covid (roberts et al., 2020).
they are all few-shot ad-hoc retrieval datasets where the number oflabeled queries is limited.
we leverage the “com-plete” version of trec-covid whose retrievaldocument set is the july 16, 2020 release of cord-19 (wang et al., 2020a), a growing collection of sci-entiﬁc papers on covid-19 and related research.
evaluation settings.
we evaluate supervisedir methods through re-ranking the top 100 docu-ments from the ﬁrst-stage retrieval with ﬁve-foldcross-validation, consistent with prior work (xionget al., 2017a; dai and callan, 2019; zhang et al.,2020b).
the ﬁrst-stage retrieval for clueweb09-band robust04 is the sequential dependence model.
5033(sdm) (metzler and croft, 2005) released by daiand callan (2019), and the ﬁrst-stage retrieval fortrec-covid is bm25 (robertson and zaragoza,2009) well-tuned by anserini (yang et al., 2017).

ndcg@20 is used as the primary met-ric for all datasets.

two groups of baselines are com-pared in our experiments, including traditional irbaselines and neural ir baselines..traditional ir baselines.
following previous re-search (dai and callan, 2019; zhang et al., 2020b),we compare four traditional ir methods in ourexperiments.
they are two unsupervised meth-ods, bm25 (robertson and zaragoza, 2009) andsdm (metzler and croft, 2005), and two learning-to-rank (ltr) methods using bag-of-word features,ranksvm (joachims, 2002) and coor-ascent(coordinate ascent) (metzler and croft, 2007)..neural ir baselines.
we also compare sevenneu-ir baselines that utilize different methodolo-gies to train neural rankers.
in our experiments,all neu-ir methods adopt the widely-used bertranker (nogueira and cho, 2019), bert-firstp,which only uses the ﬁrst paragraph of documents.
the vanilla neural baseline only leverages the ex-isting small-scale relevance labels of target datasetsto train bert rankers, which is named few-shotsupervision.
we also compare bert rankerstrained with two large-scale supervision sources:bing user click and ms marco.
dai andcallan (2019) train bert rankers with 5 millionuser click logs in bing.
we borrow their reportedresults because commercial logs are not publiclyavailable.
ms marco is a human supervisionsource (nguyen et al., 2016), which provides overone million bing queries with relevance labels..four weak supervision methods are also com-pared.
one baseline is title fitler, whichtreats ﬁltered title-document pairs as weak super-vision signals (macavaney et al., 2019) for train-ing bert rankers (zhang et al., 2020b).
anothertwo baselines are anchor and reinfoselect.
anchor leverages 100k pairs of anchor texts andweb pages to train bert rankers (zhang et al.,2020b).
reinfoselect ﬁrst employs reinforce-ment learning to select these anchor signals (zhanget al., 2020b) and then trains bert rankers.

bert ranker.
for our methods and all neu-irbaselines, we use the base version of bert (devlinet al., 2019) on clueweb09-b and robust04, andpubmedbert (base) (gu et al., 2020) on trec-covid.
we leverage the openmatch (liu et al.,2021) implementation and obtain the pre-trainedweights from hugging face (wolf et al., 2020)..for all neu-ir methods, we ﬁrst use additionalsupervision sources such as weak supervision sig-nals to train bert rankers (except for few-shotsupervision); then ﬁne-tune the bert rankerswith the training folds of target datasets in the cross-validation.
following prior work (dai and callan,2019; zhang et al., 2020b), the ranking features([cls] embeddings) of bert are combined withthe ﬁrst-stage retrieval scores using coor-ascentfor clueweb09-b and robust04.
we set the maxinput length to 512 and use adam optimizer with alearning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 8..contrastive supervision synthesis.

we set the maximum input length to 512 anduse adam to optimize the t5-nlg models with alearning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 4. in in-ference, the t5-nlg models are applied on targetdatasets with greedy search.
additionally, we con-sider ctsyncsup as our ablation baseline, whichdirectly trains bert rankers on contrastive syn-thetic supervision data without meta-reweighting.

metaadaptrank even outperforms the strong neu-ir baselines supervised with bing user click andms marco, which demonstrates its effectiveness.
speciﬁcally, ctsyncsup directly improves thefew-shot ranking accuracy of bert rankers by 3%on all benchmarks.
in comparison to other weak su-pervision sources, ﬁltered title-document relations,anchor and syncsup, ctsyncsup shows more sta-ble effectiveness across different benchmarks, re-vealing its domain-adaption advantages.
moreover,meta-reweighting ctsyncsup brings further im-provement and helps metaadaptrank outperformthe latest selective neu-ir method reinfoselect..next, we go ahead to analyze metaadaptrank’s.
contrastive synthesis and meta-reweighting..5.2 effectiveness of contrastive synthesis.
we analyze contrastive synthesis’s effectiveness byits effect on ranking results and synthetic quality.
table 3 presents the ranking accuracy based onour ctsyncsup and four other supervision sources.
ctsyncsup outperforms anchor and syncsup sta-bly across all datasets.
on robust04, ctsyncsupeven shows better performance than ms marcohuman labels.
besides, combining the sources ofms marco and ctsyncsup can further improvethe ranking accuracy on clueweb09-b and trec-covid, revealing that ctsyncsup provides usefulsupervision signals applicable to various domains.
we further evaluate the quality of the queriesgenerated in syncsup and our ctsyncsup, whichare both synthetic methods for generating queriesbased on target documents.
following previousresearch (ma et al., 2021; yu et al., 2020; celiky-ilmaz et al., 2020), eight auto evaluation metricsare used in our evaluation.
as shown in table 4,ctsyncsup outperforms syncsup on all metrics.

in addition, reversing the encoding order of the con-trastive document pair causes a dramatic decreasein all evaluation scores of the generated queries.
this further shows that our contrastive query gen-erator can extract more speciﬁc and representativeinformation from the positive documents, therebygenerating more discriminative queries..5.3 effectiveness of meta reweighting.
to analyze the effectiveness of meta reweighting,we employ metaadaptrank on different supervi-sion sources and study its data weighting behaviorsin the learning process.
the reinforcement data se-lector reinfoselect is used as a comparison, whichutilizes the trial-and-error weighting mechanism.
the ranking accuracy of metaadaptrank and.
reinfoselect trained with ms marco, anchor,and ctsyncsup is presented in table 5. for allsupervision sources, metaadaptrank outperformsreinfoselect on all benchmarks.
the results showthat the meta-reweighting mechanism can more ef-fectively explore the potential of different supervi-sion sources compared to the trial-and-error weight-ing mechanism.
moreover, the advantages of metareweighting can be extended to the hybrid supervi-sion source of ms marco and ctsyncsup..to further understand the behaviors of metareweighting, we compare the state of weights as-signed to synthetic supervision by metaadaptrankand reinfoselect in the learning process, usingctsyncsup as synthetic data and clueweb09 astarget data.
the results are shown in figure 2. eventhough each synthetic batch is likely to include both.

the weights are marked in theparenthesis ↑ (more important) and ↓ (down-weight).
the red texts are speciﬁc contents of positive documents andthe blue texts are shared by both positive and negative documents.
the document snippets are manually selected..useful and noisy data points, reinfoselect alwaysassigns very high weights at the beginning and dis-cards almost all synthetic data points later.
besides,its tight conﬁdence interval reveals that data pointsin the same batch received almost identical weights.
these observations indicate that reinfoselect doesnot effectively distinguish useful synthetic datapoints from the noisy ones during the learning pro-cess.
by contrast, metaadaptrank assigns higherweights initially and steadily reduces the weightsas training goes on.
more importantly, its wide con-ﬁdence interval reveals that the data weights in thesame synthetic batch vary signiﬁcantly, which arethus expected to be more diverse and ﬁne-grained..5.4 effectiveness of hybrid supervision.
we also analyze metaadaptrank’s advantages onthe hybrid supervision source of ms marco andctsyncsup.
the impact of the hybrid source on itsranking accuracy and meta-reweighting behavioris studied.
besides, we evaluate metaadaptranktrained with the hybrid source in round 5 of thetrec-covid shared task in which many strongbaselines have been well-tuned for four rounds..figure 3a shows the win/tie ranking accuracy ofmetaadaptrank trained with ms marco and the.
hybrid supervision source.
compared to the singlems marco, the hybrid source has more advan-tages across all benchmarks.
besides, the hybridadvantage seems to be more evident in non-webdomain benchmarks, especially on trec-covid..we further investigate the weighting behavior ofmetaadaptrank on ms marco and the hybridsource, using the same clueweb09 target data inprevious analyses.
figure 3b illustrates the changesin meta-learned weights of randomly sampled 2kms marco data points before and after mergingctsyncsup source.
there are signiﬁcant weightvariations on most ms marco data points beforeand after merging ctsyncsup.
additionally, merg-ing ctsyncsup reduces the weight of more msmarco data points, revealing that ctsyncsupdata are assigned higher weights.
this also revealsthat metaadaptrank can tailor diversiﬁed weightsfor the same data points in different sources andup-weights more useful training data ﬂexibly..lastly, we report the trec-covid r5 rankingresults of metaadaptrank trained with the hybridsource.
the top 2 automatic search systems in ther5 leaderboard are compared, which outperformsother systems on the newly added queries in r5.
the evaluation of these new queries is fair to our.
5037methods and those systems that underwent previousrounds (r1-r4).
as shown in table 6, our singlemodel outperforms the top 2 fusion-based systemson all evaluation of the new, old, and all queries, fur-ther showing the effectiveness of metaadaptrankwith the hybrid supervision source.
more detailsand ranking results are shown in appendices a.2..5.5 case studies.
table 7 exhibits some cases of contrastive syntheticdata for clueweb09 and their meta-learned weights.
more cases are shown in appendices a.3..ctsyncsup can extract more speciﬁc contentsfrom the positive documents, e.g., “shopping withthe planet” and “make a big difference” in theﬁrst case; syncsup captures more general informa-tion, e.g., “green energy”.
compared to syncsup’squeries such as “where is jamestown beach” in thesecond case, the synthetic queries in ctsyncsupare more informative and discriminative.
notice-ably, the second case exhibits the synthetic noise,where the positive document is actually related to“bermuda’s tourism” instead of the query “historyof bermuda”.
metaadaptrank effectively ﬁltersthis noisy instance by assigning a zero weight to it..6 conclusion.
this paper presents metaadaptrank, a domainadaption method for few-shot neu-ir with con-trastive weak data synthesis and meta-reweighteddata selection.
contrastive synthesis generates in-formative queries and useful synthetic supervisionsignals.
meta-learned weights form high-resolutionchannels between target labels and synthetic sig-nals, providing robust and ﬁne-grained data selec-tion for synthetic weak supervision.
both of themcollaborate to signiﬁcantly improve the neural rank-ing accuracy in various few-shot search scenarios..acknowledgments.

following priorresearch (ren et al., 2018), we ﬁrst set the initialweights w to zeros and obtain the new weights ˜w:.
˜wj = −η.
∂∂(wj).
m(cid:88).
i=1.
1m.(cid:12)li((cid:101)θt+1(w))(cid:12)(cid:12)wj =0.
..(12).
then we clip ˜w to get non-negative weights ˆw andfurther normalize them in the batch to obtain theﬁnal weights w∗:.
ˆwj = max(0, ˜wj),.
w∗.
j =.
ˆwjp=1 ˆwp) + δ((cid:80)n.((cid:80)n...p=1 ˆwp).
p=1 ˆwp) = 1 when (cid:80)n.(13)here δ((cid:80)np=1 ˆwp = 0, toprevent division errors, otherwise it is 0. with thebatch-normalization process, the hyperparameter ηcan be effectively eliminated.
the normalizationmethod is not constrained and other approachescan also be used (shu et al., 2019; hu et al., 2019)..a.2 supplementary results oftrec-covid r5.
this part supplements our evaluation results in thetrec-covid r5 shared task.
we will ﬁrst recapthe shared task and then present more evaluationresults and our implementation details..trec-covid r5.
the trec-covid chal-lenge is an ad-hoc ranking task for covid-19 liter-ature, consisting of ﬁve rounds.
trec-covid r5is the last round of this challenge, where the docu-ment set is the july 16, 2020 version of cord-19,.
and the query set contains 50 testing queries.
theﬁrst 45 queries have been used in previous rounds(r1-r4), and the last ﬁve queries are newly addedin r5.
as in previous rounds, trec-covid r5adopts residual collection evaluation (salton andbuckley, 1997).
in residual collection evaluation,the relevance labels from previous rounds can beused, but any document that has been annotated fora query will be removed before the evaluation.
wefocus more on the evaluation of r5’s new queriesbecause these queries have no prior relevance la-bels, which is fairer to our models and those searchsystems that underwent previous rounds..evaluation results.
table 8 shows the evalua-tion results on the new queries of trec-covidr5, including three variants of our metaadaptrankand the top 10 feedback systems in the r5 leader-board.
compared with the top 10 feedback systems(many are fusion-based systems), our single modelmetaadaptrank (rerank fusion.2) outperforms allbaselines, demonstrating the generalization abilityof our method on new queries..additionally, what catches our attention is thatthe best and worst of the top 10 feedback systemsonly have a 5.1% difference in ndcg@20 scoreson all queries, while their ndcg@20 scores onthe new queries differ by 13.4%.
this discrepancyindicates that the residual collection evaluation mayhave biases between the seen and unseen queries.
implementation details.
we next describe theimplementation details of the three variants of ourmetaadaptrank in trec-covid r5.
consistentwith the implementation methods described in sec-tion 4, we rerank the top 100 documents from theﬁrst-stage retrieval.
we ﬁrst borrow two retrievalresults with different settings provided by anserinibm25 (row 7 and 8 of table round 51).
thenpudmedbert (base) is used to rerank these tworetrieval results to obtain metaadaptrank (rerankfusion.1) and metaadaptrank (rerank fusion.2),respectively.
metaadaptrank (rrf) is the recipro-cal rank fusion of these two models.
we utilize theopen-source library trec-tools (palotti et al., 2019)to implement rrf and set the fusion weight k to 1.to train metaadaptrank, we ﬁrst synthesizectsyncsup data based on r5’s document set andleverage the hybrid source of ctsyncsup and msmarco as the additional supervision signals.
thetraining process contains two stages.
we ﬁrst train.

both the batch size and the accumulation stepare set to 8. in addition, to ensure a fair comparisonwith the submitted search systems, we post-processour results according to ofﬁcial guidelines..a.3 supplementary case studies.
table 9 shows more cases for the other two datasets,robust04 (news) and trec-covid (biomed), toverify the effectiveness of metaadaptrank in dif-ferent domains.
the ﬁrst three cases are from ro-bust04, and the rest cases are from trec-covid..for the ﬁrst synthetic cases, our ctsyncsup canextract characteristic keywords, e.g., “radars” and“colombia”, from the positive documents to gener-ate more informative queries, while syncsup tendsto capture general keywords to create broad queries,which may lack the ability to distinguish betweendifferent documents.
besides, ctsyncsup can ex-tract some necessary themes from the speciﬁc doc-uments, such as the particular time “1993” and theadjective “increased”, as shown in the second case.
moreover, cases 4 and 5 show the effectivenessof our contrastive synthesis for biomedical domains.
ctsyncsup can capture “lung” and “quarantineprevent” instead of general keywords, such as “sarscov” and “symptoms” often mentioned in covid-related documents.
these observations show thatctsyncsup can extract more speciﬁc information.
5042to generate more informative and discriminativequeries for different target domains..we further explore those synthetic instancesthat are assigned zero weights by metaadaptrank,such as the third and sixth cases.
in the third case,although ctsyncsup captures the two keywords“language” and “osvaldo rodrigrez” from the posi-tive document, its synthetic query is actually lessrelevant to the main topic of the positive document.
for the sixth case, ctsyncsup fails to exclude the.
phrase “covid-19 pandemic” related to both thepositive and negative documents, which causes thesynthetic query unable to distinguish between them.
fortunately, metaadaptrank can effectively iden-tify the synthetic instances whose relevance match-ing patterns between synthetic queries and positivedocuments are unclear or non-unique and then pre-cludes such misleading synthetic supervision databy assigning them zero weights..5043
