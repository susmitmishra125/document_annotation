abstract.
into developing nlg techniques..technology for language generation has ad-vanced rapidly, spurred by advancements inpre-training large models on massive amountsof data and the need for intelligent agents tocommunicate in a natural manner.
while tech-niques can effectively generate ﬂuent text, theycan also produce undesirable societal biasesthat can have a disproportionately negative im-pact on marginalized populations.
languagegeneration presents unique challenges for bi-ases in terms of direct user interaction andthe structure of decoding techniques.
to bet-ter understand these challenges, we present asurvey on societal biases in language gener-ation, focusing on how data and techniquescontribute to biases and progress towards re-ducing biases.
motivated by a lack of studieson biases from decoding techniques, we alsoconduct experiments to quantify the effectsof these techniques.
by further discussinggeneral trends and open challenges, we callto attention promising directions for researchand the importance of fairness and inclusivityconsiderations for language generation appli-cations..1.introduction.
natural language generation (nlg) is a suite oftechniques that enables the generation of human-readable language for different goals.
these tech-niques are the core components of applicationssuch as virtual assistants, chat bots, automatic trans-lators, summarizers, and creative language com-posers.
recent advances in techniques for languagegeneration (e.g., gpt (radford et al., 2018), gpt-2(radford et al., 2019), gpt-3 (brown et al., 2020),transformerxl (dai et al., 2019), xlnet (yanget al., 2019)) powered by transformers (vaswaniet al., 2017) and an increasing repository of avail-able data have created more capable applications.
this has, in turn, channeled more interest and effort.
we emphasize the importance of better under-standing how societal biases manifest in nlg tech-niques, because nlg applications directly inter-act with many different users to generate novelcontent in various domains (e.g., chat bots forhealth, education, and customer support).
however,when techniques are less effective or detrimentalfor marginalized populations, these techniques caninadvertently become gatekeepers of those popula-tions for generation and associated language tech-nologies.
for example, an educational chat bot thatproduces more negative responses for topics abouta speciﬁc ethnicity will discourage users of that eth-nicity from interacting with the chat bot.
while itis generally important to study the societal impactof nlp and ai techniques, we argue that the directuser impact of nlg techniques makes it especiallyimportant to carefully quantify the impact..motivated by the importance of fairness in lan-guage generation, we present the ﬁrst comprehen-sive survey on societal biases in language genera-tion.
by enumerating how nlg techniques con-tribute to biases and examining progress towardsbias analysis and mitigation, we contextualize thediscussion of broader trends and challenges.
specif-ically, we focus on techniques for nlg tasks, i.e.,tasks that generate a sequence of text.1 finding alack of studies on biases from decoding techniques,we additionally present an experimental study toquantify the effects of various decoding techniques.
before we delve into the details of biases in lan-guage generation, we ﬁrst position our survey inthe context of other relevant surveys and positionpapers.
sun et al.
(2019) present a focused survey.
1although bi-directional language models like bert (de-vlin et al., 2019) can also be used for auto-regressive gener-ation (wang and cho, 2019; chen et al., 2020), traditionalauto-regressive models are still typically of better quality andmore widely used for generation (shwartz et al., 2020).
thus,we limit the scope of this survey to the latter models..proceedingsofthe59thannualmeetingoftheassociationforcomputationallinguisticsandthe11thinternationaljointconferenceonnaturallanguageprocessing,pages4275–4293august1–6,2021.©2021associationforcomputationallinguistics4275demo.

addition-ally, blodgett et al.
(2020) urge for more explicitlytying “biases” in nlp to societal normative deﬁ-nitions of biases and social hierarchies; with theirrecommendations in mind, we discuss the negativeimpacts of biases in nlg techniques..our contributions are a comprehensive surveyon societal biases in language generation and anexperimental study on biases from decoding tech-niques.
to start, we describe classes of nlg tasks(sec.
2) and subsequently examine examples of bi-ases and harms in nlg (sec.
3).
we then discussnlg techniques that facilitate biases, including astudy of decoding techniques (sec.

6 presentsopen problems and proposals.
we hope this surveybrings more visibility to the importance of carefullyconsidering different components of nlg pipelinesfor potential biases and mitigation methods..2 language generation tasks.
to begin, we categorize generation tasks and in-troduce existing bias studies relevant to each task.
nlg tasks broadly fall into two categories: those.
that generate text continuations conditioned onsome prompt and those that transform text fromone form to another.
table 1 organizes variousbias-related works for nlg tasks..2.1 continuation generation tasks.
the continuation class includes autocomplete anddialogue generation, where the goal is to generatetext that is coherent and relevant to a prompt.
autocomplete generation we use the term au-tocomplete generation to refer to conditional gen-eration directly from language models.
languagemodels are the core components for many nlgand nlu tasks, and this task enables directly quan-tifying biases in large, pre-trained language models(bordia and bowman, 2019; sheng et al., 2019;solaiman et al., 2019; brown et al., 2020).
exist-ing works analyzing biases in autocomplete gen-eration have mostly examined transformer-basedmodels, including gpt (shwartz et al., 2020), gpt-2 (solaiman et al., 2019; sheng et al., 2019, 2020;shwartz et al., 2020; vig et al., 2020; yeo and chen,2020; huang et al., 2020; dhamala et al., 2021;schick et al., 2021), gpt-3 (brown et al., 2020),ctrl (dhamala et al., 2021), transformerxl(shwartz et al., 2020; vig et al., 2020; huang et al.,2020), and xlnet (shwartz et al., 2020; vig et al.,.
42762020; yeo and chen, 2020), though bordia andbowman (2019); qian et al.
(2019) also look atlstm-based models.
dialogue generation dialogue generation isconditioned on user inputs and can be for spe-ciﬁc domains (e.g., health, customer service) andtasks (e.g., behavior intervention, booking ﬂights)or general chit-chat.
these dialogue applicationsdirectly interact with users, and any propagatedbiases directly affect user behavior and actions.
in terms of recurrent dialogue models, hendersonet al.
(2018) analyze biases in hierarchical recur-rent encoder-decoder architectures and liu et al.
(2020a,b) analyze lstm-based encoder-decodermodels.
other works on dialogue biases (dinanet al., 2020a; sheng et al., 2020, 2021b) focuson transformer-based models such as dialogpt(zhang et al., 2020) and other custom architectures..2.2 transformation generation tasks.
the transformation class includes machine trans-lation and various formulations of text re-writing.
the general goal of these tasks is to transform textinto a form with targeted properties.
machine translation translation is the task oftransforming text between languages while pre-serving the meaning.
existing works on biasesin machine translation have almost exclusively fo-cused on issues of gender biases2 in a variety ofacademic and commercial systems.
the use ofgrammatical gender in some languages and not inothers can expose unwanted gender associations(e.g., for different occupations) through translation(prates et al., 2019).
earlier works by vanmassen-hove et al.
(2018) and elaraby et al.
(2018) studylstm-based encoder-decoder translation systems,and more recent works examine transformer-basedarchitectures (escud´e font and costa-juss`a, 2019;stanovsky et al., 2019; saunders and byrne, 2020;saunders et al., 2020; costa-juss`a and de jorge,2020; basta et al., 2020; stafanoviˇcs et al., 2020;renduchintala and williams, 2021; choubey et al.,2021; saunders et al., 2021; tomalin et al., 2021).
while google translate3 has been the most pop-ular commercial system to analyze for gender bi-ases (prates et al., 2019; moryossef et al., 2019;stanovsky et al., 2019; cho et al., 2019; farkasand n´emeth, 2020), stanovsky et al.

(2021) also examine yandex.9re-writing we use the term re-writing to referto tasks of revising speciﬁc words and phrases inthe original text to be more aligned with a targetedattribute.
speciﬁcally, there have been studies onre-inﬂection (habash et al., 2019; zmigrod et al.,2019; alhafni et al., 2020) and re-writing text to useneutral viewpoints (pryzant et al., 2020), gender-neutral english (sun et al., 2021), or more agency(ma et al., 2020).
these tasks typically rely oncustom encoder-decoder models..2.3 other tasks.
there are other nlg tasks, such as the continua-tion tasks of story and poetry generation, and thetransformation tasks of abstractive summarizationand paraphrase generation.
however, these othernlg tasks are not yet well-studied in the contextof societal biases.10.
3 biases and their negative impacts.
in this section, we introduce how existing studiesof biases in nlg tasks commonly quantify biasesand their negative impacts..3.1 bias deﬁnitions and metrics.
in the context of ai fairness, the term “bias” com-monly refers to skews that result in undesirableimpacts (crawford, 2017) and is quantiﬁable withsome metric.
there are relatively more existingstudies on biases in nlu tasks, where it is arguablysimpler to deﬁne bias metrics, since we can intu-itively compare the accuracy of the task (e.g., coref-erence resolution, hate speech detection) for differ-ent demographics.
language generation tasks ofteninvolve stochastic generation of open-ended andlengthy texts, traits that are not directly compatiblewith traditional algorithmic bias deﬁnitions (e.g.,.
4https://www.bing.com/translator5https://aws.amazon.com/translate6https://www.systransoft.com7https://papago.naver.com8https://translate.kakao.com9https://translate.yandex.com10lucy and bamman (2021) is an exception that analyzesgender in generated stories.
while there are studies of bi-ases in poetry generation and summarization, they focus onnon-nlg biases: sheng and uthus (2020) investigate biasesin a poetry composition system, but in the context of infor-mation retrieval; celis and keswani (2020) analyze biases inextractive summarization..4277equalized odds, equal opportunity, demographicparity (dwork et al., 2012; hardt et al., 2016))..because of the difﬁculty in deﬁning metrics, ex-isting works deﬁne bias loosely as demographicinequality and use intermediate proxy metrics tocomparatively measure bias.
examples include:• regard ratio: negative-neutral-positive regardscore ratios of text generated from bias-inducingprompts (sheng et al., 2019).
• sentiment ratio: negative-neutral-positive sen-timent score ratios of text generated from africanamerican english (aae) versus white-alignedenglish (wae) prompts (groenwold et al., 2020)• individual and group fairness through sen-timent: comparisons of the sentiment distribu-tions of generated text across demographics andprompts (huang et al., 2020).
• gendered word co-occurrence score: meanand standard deviations of the absolute log ra-tio of probabilities: p(word|female terms) top(word|male terms) across all words in gener-ated text (bordia and bowman, 2019).
there are also metrics for other bias evaluationsetups in continuation generation tasks involvingsentiment (shwartz et al., 2020), the ratio of gen-dered words (solaiman et al., 2019; vig et al., 2020;dinan et al., 2020a), and other novel metrics (penget al., 2020; yeo and chen, 2020).
studies of biasesin transformation generation tasks favor metrics ofaccuracy in terms of successfully transforming textto have a desired property.
we present a more thor-ough comparison of metrics in section 5.4..bias metrics can also be categorized by how theydeﬁne associations between demographic group at-tributes and text.
biases can be towards peopledescribed in text, people who produce the text,or people to whom the text is addressed (dinanet al., 2020b).
most existing works deﬁne biasmetrics through the ﬁrst association—these biasesare relatively easier to analyze, since both the de-mographic and the textual signals of bias are en-capsulated within the text.
there are also worksthat deﬁne biases towards people who produce thetext (groenwold et al., 2020) or people to whomthe text is addressed (sheng et al., 2021b), thoughthere are relatively fewer works that study theselatter associations..pacts.
we survey detrimental representational11and allocational12 impacts (crawford, 2017; baro-cas et al., 2017; blodgett et al., 2020) used to moti-vate existing studies of bias in nlg tasks, ﬁndinglimited examples.
while representational impactsare sometimes cited, it is difﬁcult to measure theextent of the impacts.
additionally, techniquesfor effective nlg are relatively new, and existingstudies have limited knowledge of potential alloca-tional impacts.
finally, biases in nlg tasks giverise to a third type of negative impacts, which wecall vulnerability impacts..representational impacts the works in ta-ble 1 motivate (to varying degrees) studying bi-ases in nlg through potential negative representa-tional impacts, in the form of propagating stereo-types, misrepresentations, or denigrations of socialgroups.
for example, sheng et al.
(2019) enumer-ate how generated text can propagate varying socialperceptions of different demographics, and prateset al.
(2019) discuss how occupation-related genderbiases could propagate stereotypes in translation.
however, it is difﬁcult to quantify the effects of rep-resentational impacts;13 while such impacts may bemeasured indirectly (e.g.
by analyzing allocationalimpacts), we suggest long-term, interdisciplinarycollaborations to explore the direct effects of theserepresentational impacts..allocational impacts harmful allocational im-pacts result from an unequal allocation of resourcesacross groups.
since effective nlg techniquesbased on large transformer models (vaswani et al.,2017) are relatively new, most of the existing workson biases in nlg that list possible impacts onlyanalyze direct representational consequences.
areal example of a negative allocational impact iswhen machine translation errors lead to arrests(ong, 2017).
in general, technologies that are lesseffective or detrimental for certain populations be-come barriers that actively prevent those popula-tions from using the technology, leading to dimin-ished opportunities in jobs, education, health, etc.
we discuss more details in section 4.5. with contin-uous technological advances, more organizationswill turn to effective nlg techniques, making itimperative to start setting norms to reduce harmfulallocational impacts (tamkin et al., 2021)..3.2 negative impacts.
biases in nlg techniques are important to studybecause they can result in harmful, negative im-.
11unfair representations of different groups12unfair allocation of resources13kay et al.
(2015) is a rare example that explicitly studies.
the effect of representational impacts in image search..4278vulnerability impacts open-domain generationtasks can amplify a group’s vulnerability to manip-ulation and harm, which is an intermediate impactthat makes a group more susceptible to represen-tational and allocational impacts.
for example,privacy-related issues (carlini et al., 2020), misin-formation (levy et al., 2021), or radicalizing viewsin generated text could make a group more likely tobe attributed to speciﬁc stereotypes (e.g., throughaction guided by misinformation) or end up withdiminished opportunities (e.g., by having personaldata exposed and misused).
separately identifyingvulnerability impacts could help facilitate recogni-tion of other negative impacts..4 contributors to nlg biases.
in a pipeline from data collection to evaluationfor an nlg task, each component could propagatebiases.14 we emphasize the ways in which data,model architecture, decoding, evaluation, and de-ployment uniquely exacerbate biases in generationtasks.
additionally, we present an empirical studyto show how measured biases in generated text canvary based on decoding technique..4.1 biases from data.
modern nlp models often rely on large pre-trainedlanguage models, which in turn rely on a large col-lection of data to learn explicit and implicit associ-ations.
several recent pre-trained language modelsused for nlg tasks, e.g., t5 (raffel et al., 2020)and gpt-3 (brown et al., 2020), are trained on thelargest datasets used for any models.
these largemodels for generation are commonly trained onweb data, which is known to contain biased lan-guage (e.g., ferrer et al.
(2021) discover gender,religion, and ethnic biases in reddit communities).
while preprocessing is often included to ﬁlter outmalformatted data and explicitly negative content(e.g., bad words and offensive phrases), those aregenerally the only efforts to reduce biases and as-sociated impacts.
furthermore, by ﬁltering out allwords deemed “bad”, bender et al.
(2021) warnsthat we remove the discourse of marginalized pop-ulations.
paullada et al.
(2020), bender and fried-man (2018), and gebru et al.
(2018) provide morecomprehensive surveys and frameworks that focuson aspects of data creation and management that.
14task formulation and application deployment are alsopart of nlg task pipelines (kiritchenko et al., 2020), thoughwe do not focus on biases in these areas..could lead to biases, and we refer readers to theirworks for more discussion.
in the context of trans-lation, cho et al.
(2021) ﬁnd that more data canincrease translation ﬂuency but may also make thesystem more biased..4.2 biases from model architecture.
there are relatively few studies that examine modelarchitectural properties that could lead to biases.
we discuss the few efforts towards understandingmodel biases in nlg tasks and emphasize the needfor more to generalize.
for autocomplete gener-ation, vig et al.
(2020) analyze gpt-2 variantsthrough a causal mediation analysis, ﬁnding thatlarger models contain more gender bias, and biastends to be concentrated in a small number of neu-rons and attention heads.
silva et al.
(2021) ob-serve ampliﬁed biases in distilled versus originalmodels.
for machine translation, costa-juss`a et al.
(2020) note that language-speciﬁc architectures areless biased because they encode more gender in-formation than shared language encoder-decoderarchitectures.
studies like the aforementioned areuseful for designing targeted bias mitigation meth-ods (e.g., controlled generation to target speciﬁcattention heads or regularization to retain genderinformation).
however, more evidence would beneeded to generalize ﬁndings across models.15.
4.3 biases from decoding.
while nlu and nlg models have structural simi-larities, nlg tasks uniquely use search or samplingtechniques at inference time to generate text.
popu-lar techniques include:• greedy search: at each time step, choose the.
word with the highest probability..• beam search: at each time step, keep the top bhypotheses with highest probabilities; eventuallypick the hypothesis with the highest probability.
• top-k sampling (fan et al., 2018): at each timestep, re-distribute the probability mass of the topk words with highest probabilities and sample.
• nucleus sampling (holtzman et al., 2019): ateach time step, re-distribute the probability massof the smallest set of words with a cumulativeprobability exceeding p and sample..more constrained forms of generation such as ma-chine translation generally use variations of beam.
15we also refer the reader to the work of park et al.
(2018)that discusses biases in nlu tasks from model componentsthat “attend” to speciﬁc words (e.g., through attention or pool-ing), which could be applicable to nlg tasks as well..4279search; however, preferred decoding techniques aremore varied for open-domain generation.
despitevariations in ﬂuency and diversity between deter-ministic versus stochastic, search versus samplingprocedures, there are limited studies (roberts et al.,2020) on how different decoding properties affectbiases in generation.
a study on biases from decoding to studyhow decoding techniques affect biases in gener-ation, we use existing nlg bias metrics to evalu-ate text generated from different decoding meth-ods.16 we examine autocomplete generations fromgpt, gpt-2, and xlnet, using the decoding tech-niques from section 4.3. we evaluate with thefollowing bias metrics: regard ratios (sheng et al.,2019), sentiment ratios (groenwold et al., 2020),individual and group fairness through sentimentscores (huang et al., 2020), and gendered wordco-occurrence scores (bordia and bowman, 2019)(as introduced in section 3).
more experimentaldetails can be found in the appendix..in section 5.4, we distinguish between relativeand absolute score metrics to examine evaluationdifferences between nlg tasks.
here, we orga-nize our results into these categories to generalizetrends about decoding techniques.
the ratio-basedmetrics are relative score metrics, since evaluationrelies on comparing ratios between demographics.
the latter three metrics are absolute score metricsthat have target values of zero indicating no bias..for the relative score metrics, search and sam-pling techniques generate similar outcomes.
aninteresting result between sampling techniques forthe regard metric is that nucleus sampling is lessbiased yet more negative than top-k sampling.
forthe absolute score metrics, we ﬁnd that beam searchis the most unbiased technique, closely followedby greedy search and then top-k and nucleus sam-pling.
through our study, we discover that textdiversity is not accounted for in any of the biasmetrics, yet diversity can be a confounding fac-tor.
speciﬁcally, beam search is the least diverse,17followed by greedy search, top-k sampling, thennucleus sampling.
results indicate that the lessdiverse search techniques lead to better scores forindividual fairness, group fairness, and genderedword co-occurrence ratios..we hope these experimental results will encour-.

4.4 biases from evaluation.
biases can arise from both general evaluations andbias evaluations for nlg tasks.
general evaluations current standards fornlg evaluation can reinforce certain types of lan-guage and penalize others.
for example, usingperplexity as measured by models pre-trained ondatasets largely containing non-aae text leadsto an unfair evaluation of aae text.
addition-ally, the subjectivity of generation tasks means thatmuch of nlg evaluation depends on human labels.
since humans from different backgrounds are ac-customed to different societal norms and linguisticvariations, the choice of human annotators coulddrastically inﬂuence the evaluation standards forgenerated text.
bias evaluationsit is difﬁcult to evaluate so-cietal biases in nlg tasks because nlg can beopen-domain, and there are many different notionsof biases from various backgrounds and cultures(sambasivan et al., 2021).
these factors lead tothe use of a variety of metrics to evaluate biases(section 3).
to avoid experimental bias in eval-uation, we recommend using multiple metrics tocover many types of biases at various granulari-ties.
we identify three points to emphasize theneed for more comprehensive evaluations.
first,most existing works on biases in generation centeraround one demographic dimension (often genderand from a western perspective, e.g., using stan-dard western occupations).
while there has beenno comprehensive study on whether mitigating bi-ases for one demographic dimension (e.g., gender)may exacerbate biases for others (e.g., race, inter-sectional identities), this is a possibility we mustconsider.
second, most works only evaluate biasthrough a single intermediate proxy; however, dif-ferent metrics are deﬁned at different granularities(e.g., sentiment is sentence-level, gendered wordratio is word-level).
finally, different evaluationdatasets test for speciﬁc types of biases and areinﬂuenced by the backgrounds of the curators.
col-lectively evaluating biases across demographic di-mensions and granularities can thus help reduceexperimentally-biased evaluations..18results are summarized in appendix tables 2, 3, and 5..42804.5 biases from deploying systems.
in terms of deploying nlg systems, there is afeedback loop that beneﬁts some communities andfurther disadvantages others.
while this feedbackloop is not unique to nlg systems, these systemsthat directly interact with users make good caution-ary examples..first, many deployed language technologies re-quire internet access both to use and contributefeedback, thus favoring the views and languages ofthose privileged with this access.
for example, any-one can contribute feedback to google translate,but if contributions and subsequent improvementsare focused on high-resource languages, this fur-ther increases the accuracy gap between the highand low resource languages, diminishing opportuni-ties for speakers of the low resource languages, i.e.,representation disparity (hashimoto et al., 2018).
second, those who are unable to achieve theirgoals from using these language technologies (e.g.,unsuccessful translation, unhelpful or offensivechat bot) are less likely to continue using the tech-nology.
this means that there is less feedback anddata to improve the technologies, reinforcing thedecreased effectiveness for certain populations, i.e.,disparity ampliﬁcation (hashimoto et al., 2018)..one way we might intervene is to follow a moretargeted approach for data and feedback collection,e.g., from excluded populations.
however, we ac-knowledge that this remains a difﬁcult task andthat it is also necessary to be aware of “commu-nity goals” and other factors in order to co-designlanguage technologies without inﬂicting additionalharm on marginalized populations (bird, 2020)..5 progress, trends, and challenges.
following the discussion of contributors to biases,we survey trends and challenges for reducing biasesin nlg..5.1 data methods.
data-based methods for both bias analysis and mit-igation use the general idea of counterfactual dataaugmentation (cda) (lu et al., 2020) to curate setsof counterfactual prompts.
a common method foranalysis is using targeted prompts to induce nlgmodels to reveal biases.
for data-based mitigation,existing works focus on ﬁne-tuning large modelsor training smaller models with datasets that arebalanced with respect to targeted demographics..curated datasets existing datasets to study bi-ases in translation include parallel sentences taggedwith speaker or subject gender information (van-massenhove et al., 2018; habash et al., 2019) anddatasets to study gender biases when translatingfrom neutral references of a person (e.g., nurse inenglish, gender-neutral pronouns) to gendered in-stances (e.g., enfermera or enfermero in spanish,gendered pronouns) (cho et al., 2019; stanovskyet al., 2019; gonen and webster, 2020; kocmi et al.,2020).
renduchintala and williams (2021) addi-tionally provide a dataset to study translation ofneutral references in unambiguous contexts.
otherworks present parallel corpora of biased versus un-biased framings and presuppositions (pryzant et al.,2020) and aae versus wae equivalents (groen-wold et al., 2020).
sheng et al.
(2019); huang et al.
(2020); dhamala et al.
(2021) additionally curatesets of prompts that can be used to evaluate biasesin autocomplete generation.
bias analysis most bias analyses of nlg tasksuse prompts to probe for different biases in gener-ated text, e.g., regarding social perception (shenget al., 2019), gender in translation (prates et al.,2019), names (shwartz et al., 2020), sentimentdistribution (huang et al., 2020), dialects (groen-wold et al., 2020), dialogue personas (sheng et al.,2021a), or other notions of similarity across demo-graphics (yeo and chen, 2020; henderson et al.,2018).
vig et al.
(2020) also use prompts to investi-gate gender biases, though they do so in the contextof a causal mediation analysis.
furthermore, prateset al.
(2019) and farkas and n´emeth (2020) com-pare pronoun gender biases in translations (inducedwith prompts) to real-world statistics.
bias mitigation methods can broadly be classi-ﬁed into two categories based on the type of data ap-plied.
the ﬁrst category encompasses methods thatﬁne-tune or train on a balanced dataset to lessenthe effects of the model relying on spurious corre-lations between imbalanced data and task perfor-mance.
cda has been applied to datasets used forcontinued or fresh training in dialogue generation(dinan et al., 2020a; liu et al., 2020a) as well asmachine translation (saunders and byrne, 2020;costa-juss`a and de jorge, 2020; stafanoviˇcs et al.,2020).
the second category is methods that at-tach a short preﬁx at training time (vanmassenhoveet al., 2018; basta et al., 2020; alhafni et al., 2020)or inference time (moryossef et al., 2019).
challenges the size of state-of-the-art pre-trained models and varying deﬁnitions of biases.
4281in generation present difﬁculties for creating stan-dardized datasets that are generally effective acrossbiases and demographics.
moreover, it remains tobe seen whether data-based mitigation is as effec-tive for open-domain nlg tasks as it is for moreconstrained settings..5.2 training methods.
in addition to data-based mitigation, training-basedmitigation is another popular class of methods toreduce biases in generation.
bias mitigation several works that use training-based mitigation techniques rely on regularization(bordia and bowman, 2019; qian et al., 2019;huang et al., 2020; liu et al., 2020a; saunders andbyrne, 2020).
there are also works that induce con-trol by incorporating a bias control code throughconditional training (dinan et al., 2020a), by ap-pending a target value to inputs during training(ma et al., 2020), by using a normative classiﬁer toproduce reward values for backpropagation (penget al., 2020), or through adversarial training (liuet al., 2020b).
other techniques include using de-biased word embeddings (escud´e font and costa-juss`a, 2019), identifying and editing out subjectivewords (pryzant et al., 2020), and using markov ran-dom ﬁelds to preserve morpho-syntactic agreementduring reinﬂection (zmigrod et al., 2019).
challenges the main challenge of bias mitiga-tion through training methods is that it is costly andimpractical to re-train models for new biases en-countered.
in fact, most of the techniques that relyon training from scratch use smaller architectures(exceptions are from larger institutions)..5.3.inference methods.
while the existing literature on inference time meth-ods for bias mitigation is sparse, decoding-basedmethods are a promising alternative to data- andtraining-based methods.
speciﬁcally, these meth-ods are compatible with any pre-trained languagemodel for generation without additional training.
given recent development of inference-time meth-ods for control that can reduce toxicity (e.g., pplm(dathathri et al., 2019), gedi (krause et al., 2020),dexperts (liu et al., 2021)), there is potential forextending these methods to bias mitigation.
bias mitigation for autocomplete and dialoguegeneration, sheng et al.
(2020) formulate bias trig-gers using gradient-based methods of wallace et al.
(2019).
these triggers are appended to promptsduring inference time to control text generation to.
be more equalized towards different demographics.
for translation, saunders and byrne (2020) presenta lattice rescoring procedure that creates gender-inﬂected search spaces to rescore text for more ac-curate translations, and saunders et al.
(2021) sub-sequently use this lattice structure to present moregendered options during beam search and reranktranslation hypotheses according to gender criteria.
for dialogue generation, sheng et al.
(2021b) in-troduce a constrained decoding method that usesn-gram similarity to guide generation away fromad hominems towards marginalized groups.
for au-tocomplete generation, schick et al.
(2021) presenta self-debiasing scheme that re-weights word prob-abilities to generate less undesirable words.
challenges control methods at inference timecould potentially steer the model into degeneratespaces, so it is important to also evaluate thesemethods for coherence, ﬂuency, and task relevance..5.4 evaluation methods.
there are two types of evaluations: those that relyon absolute scores and those that rely on relativescores.
absolute score evaluations use an accu-mulated score to summarize inequalities betweendemographics, whereas relative evaluations explic-itly report inequalities between all demographics.
while it is possible to convert between relative andabsolute scores, distinguishing between how exist-ing works choose to portray evaluations allows usto examine differences between generation tasks.
absolute evaluations we ﬁnd that the transfor-mation class of generation tasks favors bias evalu-ation through absolute metrics, which is possiblebecause these tasks involve relatively more con-strained forms of generation.
examples of eval-uation objectives through absolute scores includepeng et al.
(2020) reducing non-normative gener-ations, ma et al.
(2020) increasing the accuracyof the change in agency, zmigrod et al.
(2019) in-creasing the number of correct inﬂections, huanget al.
(2020) reducing individual and group fair-ness scores, and sheng et al.
(2021b) reducingthe amount of ad hominems towards marginalizedgroups.
studies of gender bias in machine trans-lation are well-suited to evaluations using abso-lute scores: many use bleu and its variants toevaluate correct gender inﬂections and translations(moryossef et al., 2019; escud´e font and costa-juss`a, 2019; elaraby et al., 2018; habash et al.,2019; alhafni et al., 2020) or accuracy on winomt(saunders and byrne, 2020; saunders et al., 2020;.
4282kocmi et al., 2020; costa-juss`a and de jorge, 2020;costa-juss`a et al., 2020; basta et al., 2020; choubeyet al., 2021; saunders et al., 2021).
relative evaluationsin terms of evaluationthrough relative scores, examples from existingworks are mainly from continuation generationtasks.
we infer that the less constrained, open-domain nature of continuation generation tasksmakes it more preferable to evaluate mitigationthrough more ﬂexible comparisons rather than ab-solute scores.
for autocomplete generation, shenget al.
(2019, 2020) and groenwold et al.
(2020)compare regard or sentiment scores across demo-graphics, shwartz et al.
(2020) compare namesacross various intermediate metrics, vig et al.
(2020) measure proportional differences betweenthe amount of bias under a gendered versus ambigu-ous reading, and yeo and chen (2020) compareoccupations generated for different genders.
biasstudies in dialogue generation use relative scoresby comparing sentiment and offensive languagediscrepancies (henderson et al., 2018; liu et al.,2020a,b) and the percentage of gendered words(dinan et al., 2020a).
challenges a trade-off between framing biasesas a relative or absolute metric is that relative met-rics can be more ﬂexibly aligned to normative con-cerns like social perception.
absolute metrics thatlook for ratios of gendered words or other indica-tor words assume that there is a set of words thatcaptures all the differences between demographicgroups, regardless of whether these differences arerelated to normative deﬁnitions of harm.
thereare also absolute metrics such as those of huanget al.
(2020) that can incorporate intermediate met-rics that are more aligned with normative behavior,though these metrics reduce the notion of biases toa single value, which could erase historical inequal-ities between groups..6 open problems and proposals.
as a fairly nascent area of exploration, the studyof biases in language generation still poses manychallenges.
throughout this paper, we discuss chal-lenges associated with different components in ageneration pipeline.
with a heightened awarenessof the relevant body of work, we conclude withrecommendations for open problems.
bias-aware data curation many works havehighlighted the harms and problems when col-lecting training datasets with limited awareness.
for potential harms.
since effective models fornlg tasks are correlated with increasing trainingdata sizes, biases in data collection (e.g., english-centric, drawn from popular western media) re-main a major contributor of biases that manifestin generation.
additionally, datasets used to studybiases in generation can also be limited (e.g., onlyfor binary gender classes).
for more bias-awaredata curation, we suggest diversifying datasets toinclude more viewpoints from various groups..understanding trade-offs different methodsfor analysis, mitigation, and evaluation have uniquetrade-offs.
existing works have been relativelysmall-scale and limited to a small number of biasesfor speciﬁc tasks.
some useful questions to con-sider when developing methods to study generationbiases are whether we can generalize methods to adiverse set of biases and a wide range of contexts.
it is also important to consider formulating met-rics that would jointly mitigate biases and preserveother desired text qualities (e.g., diversity, ﬂuency)..interactive and continuous learning the dif-ﬁculties of measuring and mitigating biases in gen-eration can be reduced with a general frameworkfor interactive and continuous learning.
over time,such a system could learn from diverse opinions ofwhat constitutes “fair” versus “unfair” generationsacross tasks.
a uniﬁed framework would centralizeand highlight the importance of studying biases ingeneration, as well as fuel the development of amore comprehensive set of evaluations that may beuseful for large-scale studies of impact..focusing on negative impacts section 3 dis-cusses how there are very few existing works onbiases that explicitly and meaningfully engage withresulting negative impacts, even though these im-pacts are what motivate reducing biases.
by re-framing efforts on reducing negative impacts ratherthan biases, we may be able to deﬁne metrics andprogress that better correlate with reducing harm.
for example, relative framings of bias metricscould better enable metrics to be more aligned withreducing harms for particularly impacted groups..acknowledgments.
we would like to thank seraphina goldfarb-tarrant,sunipa dev, jason teoh, members of the plus lab,and our anonymous reviewers for the many helpfulsuggestions that went into this paper..4283ethics and broader implications.
in this work, we present a survey and commentaryon the progress and challenges for studying societalbiases in language generation.
data we do not check the quality of the datasetsused to train popular language generation models(due to limited availability and size), though wedo brieﬂy mention problems that other works havefound regarding using large datasets that have beenminimally ﬁltered.
some of the surveyed datasetsand metrics that are used for evaluating biases ap-proximate binary genders using names typical ofspeciﬁc genders, and may be better re-formulatedto avoid harms and curate a more accurate repre-sentation of different genders.
on the subject ofgenders, the majority of bias evaluation data alsoonly evaluate for binary genders—we point out thisissue in our survey as well.
techniques most of the techniques surveyed inthis work are trained with or bias-tested with datadrawn from western sources or culture, since that islargely the focus of the existing body of work.
wealso refer to studies that point out how techniquesfor bias do not always transfer across cultures.
ourdecoding experiments could potentially fuel mis-use by giving those with adversarial interests abetter understanding of how decoding algorithmscould thwart bias metrics, though we believe trans-parency around these results outweigh the potentialfor misuse..references.

a.1 evaluating biases across decoding.
techniques and metrics.
to gain more insight into biases from different de-coding techniques, we examine autocomplete gen-erations from gpt (110m params), gpt-2 (small,117m params), and xlnet (base, 110m params),using the decoding techniques described in sec-tion 4.3 through the transformers19 library.
weuse standard parameters of b = 16 for beam search,k = 40 with a temperature of 0.7 for top-k sam-pling, and p = 0.95 for nucleus sampling (holtz-man et al., 2019).
in terms of bias metrics, weuse existing nlg bias metrics: regard ratio (shenget al., 2019), sentiment ratio (groenwold et al.,2020), individual and group fairness through sen-timent (if/gf) (huang et al., 2020), and a gen-dered word co-occurrence scores (bordia and bow-man, 2019).
for all sentiment scores, we use therule-based sentiment analyzer, vader (hutto andgilbert, 2014).20 we run all our experiments on anrtx 2080ti gpu.
generation takes from a cou-ple of minutes to a few hours, depending on thenumber of samples generated.
regard ratios sheng et al.
(2019) introduce 10prompts to induce occupation- and respect-relatedgenerations (e.g., [blank] worked as, [blank]was thought of as) and six demographics (black,white, man, woman, gay, straight) to ﬁll in the[blank], for a total of 60 prompts.
the authorsdeﬁne regard as the social perception towards a de-mographic, collect human annotations, and releasea bert-based regard classiﬁer.21 we follow theoriginal work in reporting percentages of negative,neutral, and positive regard scores per demographic.
for the deterministic search methods, we do notreport scores since there are only 10 samples perdemographic.
for the stochastic sampling methods,we generate 1000 samples per demographic.
ad-ditionally, we use the regard classiﬁer released bythe authors for our evaluations—while we acknowl-edge that this classiﬁer could also have biases, webelieve it is still worthwhile to use it to comparetext generated from different decoding techniques..19https://huggingface.co/transformers20kiritchenko and mohammad (2018) show that sentimentclassiﬁers can exhibit biases.
we use vader since 1) it doesnot rely on learned associations and thus may be less prone tobiases, and 2) it has been used to measure biases in previousworks (sheng et al., 2019; groenwold et al., 2020)..21https://github.com/ewsheng/nlg-bias.
sentiment ratios for aae and wae promptsgroenwold et al.
(2020) curate a parallel set of2,019 aae and 2,019 wae prompts and use senti-ment classiﬁers to label text generated from theprompts.
similar to sheng et al.
(2019), thiswork also reports percentages of negative, neu-tral, and positive scores.
the vader sentimentanalyzer that we use reports scores in the rangeof [-1, 1].
when reporting ratios, we use splitsrecommended by the authors (hutto and gilbert,2014) to categorize sentiment values into negative(value<=−0.05), neutral (−0.05<value<0.05),and positive (value>=0.05) bins.
when reportingaverage values, we calculate from the unroundedscores from vader.
we generate one sample perprompt for all decoding techniques..individual and group fairness through senti-ment huang et al.
(2020) evaluate fairness acrosscountries, occupations, and genders (binary, as de-ﬁned through western names typical of a gender)by ﬁrst deﬁning 10 templates per dimension (e.g.,people from [blank] are).
for each dimension,they also deﬁne a list of dimension instances (e.g.,syria as a country) to ﬁll in the [blank].
in total,there are 730 prompts across the three attributes.
for our experiments, we generate one sample perprompt..the authors deﬁne the individual fairness met-ric by “...averaging the wasserstein-1 distance be-tween the sentiment score distribution of everyevaluation sentence and each of its counterfactualsentences across all templates.” for example, wewould compute the distance between the sentimentdistributions of the text generated from the tem-plate people from [blank] are for each of thecountry choices for [blank], and sum up the dis-tance scores for all pairs across all templates..for group fairness, the authors calculate the av-erage of the “wasserstein-1 distance between thesentiment distributions of all generated sentencesof inputs from [a] subgroup, and that over the en-tire evaluation set”.
here, a subgroup means eachcountry, occupation, or binary gender.
for exam-ple, we compare the distance between the sentimentdistribution of text generated for syria (across alltemplates) and the sentiment distribution of textgenerated for all countries..we use huang et al.
(2020)’s preﬁx templatesand fairness metrics exactly as deﬁned in the origi-nal work, so we refer readers to the original workfor more details..4290gendered word co-occurrence scores thisscore is based on the one proposed by bordia andbowman (2019), though we use different genderedword lists and evaluate over all text generated forthe other bias metrics, downsampling if necessaryso that the amount and sources of generated textare consistent across decoding techniques.
first,we obtain the lists of female words and male wordsfrom zhao et al.
(2018) and add gendered pronouns(he, she, his, him, her) to the respective lists.
foreach word in the aggregated sample set, we calcu-late the probability of the word given any of thefemale words (in a context window of 20 wordsbefore and after a word) and similarly the prob-ability of the word given any of the male words.
we then take the absolute value of the log ratioof the ﬁrst probability to the second, and reportthe average and standard deviation across all non-gendered words.
more concretely, given the set offemale gendered words f , the set of male genderedwords m, unique non-gendered words w ∈ w in adataset, and the probability of a word given any ofthe set g of gendered words p(w|g), we calculatethe mean.
µ = avg(abs(log.
p(w|f )p(w|m).
)).
and standard deviation.
σ = stdev(abs(log.
p(w|f )p(w|m).
))..supplementary results supplementary to theexperimental results described in the main text, ta-ble 2 presents quantitative results.
table 3 showsregard ratios for the other demographic groups orig-inally included in the evaluation by sheng et al.
(2019).
additionally, table 4 presents averagelengths and vocabulary sizes of the samples usedin the if/gf evaluations to estimate text diversity.
these results, combined with examples of gener-ated text in table 5, provide evidence that the de-coding techniques differ in terms of generated textdiversity, and that diversity is very much correlatedwith the bias metrics if, gf, and gendered wordco-occurrence scores.
although this correlation isto be expected from the metric formulation, thisstudy raises relevant questions of whether bias met-rics should be correlated with text diversity, andwhether bias evaluations should use more compre-hensive metrics..4291model decode.

regard scores (sheng et al.,2019) and sentiment scores (groenwold et al., 2020) are reported in distribution percentages of negative-neutral-positive(avg value).
individual fairness (if) and group fairness (gf) scores (huang et al., 2020) compare senti-ment distributions of generated text across demographics.
gendered (word co-occurrence) scores are reported interms of mean±stdev of the absolute log ratio of the probabilities: p(word|female terms) to p(word|male terms)(bordia and bowman, 2019).
search-based results for regard are omitted due to lack of enough prompts to gener-ate from.
results indicate 1) nucleus sampling generates more text with negative regard, 2) decoding choices aresimilar for aae/wae sentiments though sampling generates more positive sentiment overall, 3) beam search hasrelatively lower bias as measured by if, gf, and gendered word co-occurrence scores, followed closely by greedysearch, and then top-k and nucleus sampling..model.
