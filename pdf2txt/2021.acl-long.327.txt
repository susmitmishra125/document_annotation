abstract.
correct naturallanguage understanding re-quires computers to distinguish the literal andmetaphorical senses of a word.
recent neu-ral models achieve progress on verb metaphordetection by viewing it as sequence labeling.
in this paper, we argue that it is appropri-ate to view this task as relation classiﬁca-tion between a verb and its various contexts.
we propose the metaphor-relation bert (mr-bert) model, which explicitly models the re-lation between a verb and its grammatical, sen-tential and semantic contexts.
we evaluateour method on the vua, moh-x and trofidatasets.
our method gets competitive resultscompared with state-of-the-art approaches..1.introduction.
metaphor is ubiquitous in our daily life for effec-tive communication (lakoff and johnson, 1980).
metaphor processing has become an active researchtopic in natural language processing due to its im-portance in understanding implied meanings..this task is challenging, requiring contextualsemantic representation and reasoning.
variouscontexts and linguistic representation techniqueshave been explored in previous work..early methods focused on analyzing restrictedforms of linguistic context, such as subject-verb-object type grammatical relations, based onhand-crafted features (shutova and teufel, 2010b;tsvetkov et al., 2013; gutiérrez et al., 2016).
later,word embeddings and neural networks were in-troduced to alleviate the burden of feature engi-neering for relation-level metaphor detections (reiet al., 2017; mao et al., 2018).
however, althoughgrammatical relations provide the most direct clues,other contexts in running text are mostly ignored.
recently, token-level neural metaphor detectiondraws more attention.
several approaches discov-.
∗these authors contributed equally to this work..ered that wider context can lead to better perfor-mance.
do dinh and gurevych (2016) considereda ﬁxed window surrounding each target token ascontext.
gao et al.
(2018) and mao et al.
(2018)argued that the full sentential context can providestrong clues for more accurate prediction.
somerecent work also attempted to design models moti-vated by metaphor theories (mao et al., 2019; choiet al., 2021)..despite the progress of exploiting sentential con-text, there are still issues to be addressed.
firstof all, a word’s local context, its sentential con-text and other contexts should be all important fordetecting metaphors; however, they are not wellcombined in previous work.
more importantly, asshown in figure 1, most token-level metaphor de-tection methods formulate metaphor detection aseither a single-word classiﬁcation or a sequencelabeling problem (gao et al., 2018).
the contextinformation is mainly used for learning contextualrepresentations of tokens, rather than modeling theinteractions between the target word and its con-texts (zayed et al., 2020)..in this paper, we focus on token-level verbmetaphor detection, since verb metaphors areof the most frequent type of metaphoric expres-sions (shutova and teufel, 2010a).
as shown infigure 1, we propose to formulate verb metaphordetection as a relation extraction problem, insteadof token classiﬁcation or sequence labeling formu-lations.
in analogy to identify the relations betweenentities, our method models the relations between atarget verb and its various contexts, and determinesthe verb’s metaphoricity based on the relation rep-resentation rather than only the verb’s (contextual)representation..we present a simple yet effective model —metaphor-relation bert (mrbert), which isadapted from a bert (devlin et al., 2019)based state-of-the-art relation learning model (bal-.

our model has three high-lights, as illustrated in figure 2. first, we explicitlyextract and represent context components, such asa verb’s arguments as the local context, the wholesentence as the global context, and its basic mean-ing as a distant context.
so multiple contexts can bemodeled interactively and integrated together.
sec-ond, mrbert enables modeling the metaphoricalrelation between a verb and its context components,and uses the relation representation for determiningthe metaphoricity of the verb.
third, the model isﬂexible to incorporate sophisticated relation mod-eling methods and new types of contexts..we conduct experiments on the largest metaphordetection corpus vu amsterdam metaphor corpus(vua) (steen, 2010).
our method obtains com-petitive results on the large vua dataset.

the results on relatively small datasets, such asmoh-x and trofi, also show good performanceand model transferability..2 formulating verb metaphor detection.
this section brieﬂy summarizes the common for-mulations of token-level verb metaphor detectionas a background, and discusses the relation betweenthis paper and previous work.
the task a given sentence contains a sequence ofn tokens x = x1, ..., xn, and a target verb in thissentence is xi.
verb metaphor detection is to judgewhether xi has a literal or a metaphorical sense.
basic formulations most neural networks basedapproaches cast the task as a classiﬁcation or se-quence labeling problem (do dinh and gurevych,2016; gao et al., 2018).
as shown in figure 1, theclassiﬁcation paradigm predicts a single binary la-.
bel to indicate the metaphoricity of the target verb,while the sequence labeling paradigm predicts a se-quence of binary labels to all tokens in a sentence.
based on the basic formulations, various ap-proaches have tried to enhance feature represen-tations by using globally trained contextual wordembeddings (gao et al., 2018) or incorporatingwider context with powerful encoders such as bil-stm (gao et al., 2018; mao et al., 2019) and trans-formers (dankers et al., 2019; su et al., 2020).
limitations and recent trends however,above two paradigms have some limitations..the.
first, contextual information is mostly used toenhance the representation of the target word, butthe interactions between the target word and its con-texts are not explicitly modeled (zayed et al., 2020;su et al., 2020).
to alleviate this, su et al.
(2020)proposed a new paradigm by viewing metaphor de-tection as a reading comprehension problem, whichuses the target word as a query and captures its in-teractions with the sentence and clause.
a concur-rent work to this work (choi et al., 2021) adopteda pre-trained contextualized model based late inter-action mechanism to compare the basic meaningand the contextual meaning of a word..second, exploiting wider context will bring inmore noise and may lose the focus.
fully de-pending on data-driven models to discover usefulcontexts is difﬁcult, given the scale of availabledatasets for metaphor detection is still limited.
thegrammar structures, such as verb arguments, are im-portant for metaphor processing (wilks, 1978), butis not well incorporated into neural models.
stoweet al.
(2019) showed that data augmentation basedon syntactic patterns can enhance a standard model.

mrbert considers the representations of (1) the sen-tential global context, (2) the grammatical local context, and (3) the basic meaning of the verb as a distant context.
three context integration strategies for modeling contextual relations are adopted: (a) context concatenation, (b)context average, and (c) context maxout.
contextual relation r is modeled to indicate the probability of beingmetaphorical, where linear, bilinear and neural tensor models can be applied to capture interactions between theverb and its contexts.
the relation-level and sequence-level predictions are jointly optimized..not consider speciﬁc grammatical relations.
it is in-teresting to further explore how to integrate explicitlinguistic structures for contextual modeling..this paper presents a new paradigm for verbmetaphor detection to overcome these limitations,by viewing the task as a relation extraction task.
we assume a target verb and its multiple contextsare entities, and metaphor detection is to determinewhether a metaphorical relation holds between theverb and its contexts..we will introduce the proposed model in sec-tion 3. before diving into details, we argue thatviewing metaphor as a relation is reasonable andconsistent with existing metaphor theories.
ac-cording to wilks (1978), metaphors show a viola-tion of selectional preferences in a given context.
the conceptual metaphor theory views metaphorsas transferring knowledge from a familiar, orconcrete domain to an unfamiliar, or more ab-stract domain (lakoff and johnson, 1980; turneyet al., 2011).
the metaphor identiﬁcation proce-dure (mip) theory (group, 2007) aims to identifymetaphorically used words in discourse based oncomparing their use in particular context and theirbasic meanings.
all the theories care about a kindof relations between a target word and its contexts,which may help identify metaphors..3 metaphor-relation bert (mrbert).
we propose the metaphor-relation bert (mr-bert) model to realize verb metaphor detectionas a relation classiﬁcation task..figure 2 shows the architecture of mrbert.
weuse the pre-trained language model bert as thebackbone model.
there are three main procedures:(1) extract and represent contexts; (2) model thecontextual relations between the target verb and itscontexts; (3) manipulate the contextual relationsfor predicting the verb’s metaphoricity..3.1 contexts and their representations.
3.1.1 types of contexts.
a metaphor can result when a target word interactswith a certain part in a sentence.
previous work of-ten explored individual context types, such as verbarguments through grammatical relations or thewhole sentence/clause.
little work has attemptedto summarize and combine different contexts..we summarize the following contexts, which.
would help determine verbs’ metaphoricity:.
• global context: we view the whole sentenceas the global context.
a metaphorically usedword may seem divergent to the meaning ortopic of the sentence..4242[cls][subj]he    [/subj][verb]absorbed [/verb]the      [obj]costs     [/obj]for        the     accident [sep]deeptransformer(bert)relationrepresentationandprediction𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑀𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙(𝐿)?maxouta contextconcatenationc contextmaxout⊕⊕𝑟()，++𝑟()，𝑟(，)𝑟(，)𝑟(，)𝑝(𝑟=𝑀)𝑝(𝑟=𝑀)b contextaverage𝑝(𝑟=𝑀)⊕+𝑟(，)sequenceprediction(1)(2)(3)(2)• local context: we view the words that have aclose grammatical relation to the target wordsas the local context, which is widely studiedto capture selectional preference violations..• distant context: motivated by the mip the-ory, the difference between the contextual us-age of a word and its basic meaning may in-dicate a metaphor so that we view the basicmeaning of the target verb as a distant context..then, we have to extract and represent these.
contexts..3.1.2 context extraction and representation.
we call the target verb’s contexts as context com-ponents.
to get the contextual or basic meaningsof these components.
we use the deep transformermodels, such as bert..we ﬁrst use stanford dependency parser (chenand manning, 2014) to parse each sentence andextract verb-subject and verb-direct object relationswith vb head and nn dependent.
the nominalsubjects and objects are used as the local contextcomponents..motivated by (baldini soares et al., 2019), we[subj],introduce 6 component marker tokens,[/subj], [verb], [/verb], [obj] and [/obj], to ex-plicitly label the boundaries of the target verb, itssubject and object in each sentence.
we also use[cls] and [sep ] to mark the whole sentence.
forexample, the marker inserted token sequence forthe sentence he absorbed the costs for the accidentis shown in figure 2. the whole token sequence isfed into bert’s tokenizer, and then the transformerlayers..to get the contextual representations, we use thehidden states of the ﬁnal transformer layer.
foreach marked component, we use the start marker(e.g., [subj]) or the averaged embedding betweenthe start and the end markers (e.g., [subj] and[/subj]) as the component representation..the contextual representation of the whole sen-tence is read from the ﬁnal hidden state of [cls].
to represent the basic meaning of the verb, weuse the output from the bert tokenizer to get thecontext independent verb representation.
if wordpieces exist, their averaged embedding is used..3.2 modeling the contextual relation.
the relation between the target verb and one ofits contexts is called a contextual relation.
our.
purpose is to utilize the contextual relation(s) todetermine the metaphoricity of the verb..the representations of the verb and a contextcomponent are denoted as v ∈ rd and c ∈ rk,respectively.
we adopt three ways to explicitlydeﬁne the form of the relation r for capturing theinteractions between v and c..• linear model we use a parameter vectorvr ∈ rd+k and a bias br to represent the rela-tion r, and the probability of the relation beingmetaphorical is computed according to.
p(r|v, c) = σ(v (cid:62)r.+ br),.
(1).
(cid:19).
(cid:18)vc.where σ is the sigmoid function..• bilinear model we use a parameter matrixar ∈ rd×k and a bias br to represent therelation r:.
p(r|v, c) = σ(v(cid:62)arc + br)..(2).
the components and the relation can interactmore sufﬁciently with each other in this way..• neural tensor model we also exploit a sim-pliﬁed neural tensor model for relation repre-sentation:.
p(r|v, c) = σ(v(cid:62)arc + v (cid:62)r.+ br).
(3).
(cid:19).
(cid:18)vc.3.3.integrating contextual relations forprediction.
we focus on 3 types of contextual relations:.
• verb-global relation the relation betweenthe contextual representations of the verb vand the whole sentence ccls..• verb-local relation the relation between thecontextual representations of the verb v andits subject csubj or object cobj..• verb-distant relation the relation between.
the verb v and its basic meaning vbsc..the representations of csubj, cobj, ccls and vbsccan be obtained as described in section 3.1.2. wetry three ways to integrate the contextual relations.
the ﬁrst two ways build a combined context c ﬁrst:.
• context concatenation we can concatenatethe representations of context components to-gether as the combined context, i.e., c =csubj ⊕ cobj ⊕ ccls ⊕ vbsc..4243• context average similarly, we can use theaveraged representation of all context com-ponents as the combined context, i.e., c =average(csubj, cobj, ccls, vbsc)..then we compute the probability that the relationis metaphorical, i.e., p(r|v, c), where either linear,bilinear or neutral tensor model can be applied..the other way is to choose the most conﬁdent.
single prediction, i.e.,.
• context maxout the prediction is basedon max{p(r|v, c)}, where c belongs to{ccls, csubj, cobj, vbsc}..to train the relation-level prediction model, we.
use binary cross-entropy as the loss function,.
l0 = −.
(ˆyiyi + (1 − ˆyi)(1 − yi)),.
(4).
1n.n(cid:88).
i=1.
where n is the number of training samples; ˆyi isthe golden label of a verb with ˆyi = 1 indicating ametaphorical usage and ˆyi = 0 indicating a literalusage; yi is the probability of being metaphoricalpredicted by our model..we further combine relation-level and sequence-level metaphor detection via multi-task learning.
the sequence metaphor detection uses the hiddenstates of the ﬁnal layer and a softmax layer forpredicting the metaphoricity of each token.
we usecross-entropy as the loss function and denote theaverage loss over tokens in training samples as l1.
the ﬁnal loss of mrbert is l = l0 + l1..4 evaluation.
4.1 experimental settings.
4.1.1 datasets and evaluation metricsvua dataset we mainly conduct experiments onthe vua (steen, 2010) dataset.
it is the largestpublicly available metaphor detection dataset andhas been used in metaphor detection sharedtasks (leong et al., 2018, 2020).
this dataset hasa training set and a test set.
previous work uti-lized the training set in different ways (neidleinet al., 2020).
we use the preprocessed version ofthe vua dataset provided by gao et al.
(2018).
the ﬁrst reason is that this dataset has a ﬁxed de-velopment set so that different methods can adoptthe same model selection strategy.
the second rea-son is that several recent important methods usedthe same dataset (mao et al., 2018; dankers et al.,.

50,175 and5,873 tokens are used for evaluating all-pos and verbtracks, respectively..2019; stowe et al., 2019; le et al., 2020).
there-fore it is convenient for us to compare the proposedmethod with previous work..there are two tracks: verb and all-posmetaphor detection.
some basic statistics of thedataset are shown in table 1. we focus on theverb track since we mainly model metaphorical re-lations for verbs.
we use mrbert’s relation-levelpredictions for the verb track and use its sequencelabeling module to deal with the all-pos track.
moh-x and trofi datasets moh-x (moham-mad et al., 2016) and trofi (birke and sarkar,2006) are two relatively smaller datasets comparedwith vua.
only a single target verb is annotated ineach sentence.
we will report the results on moh-x and trofi in three settings: zero-shot transfer,re-training and ﬁne-tuning.

(2021) (melbert) present a con-current work to ours.
the method shares simi-lar ideas and architecture with us, but it doesnot consider the grammatical relations..notice that the systems participating in the vuametaphor detection shared tasks (leong et al., 2018,2020) can use any way to manipulate the trainingset for model selection and ensemble learning sothat the reported results in the task report are notdirectly comparable to us.
the results of deep-met and melbert are based on the single modelevaluation in (choi et al., 2021)..the ﬁrst four baselines do not utilize pre-trainedlanguage models, while the last three baselinesuse bert or roberta.
these baselines supportcomprehensive comparisons from multiple aspects..4.1.3 parameter conﬁgurationduring context component extraction, if the targetverb does not have a subject or an object, we usea ﬁxed zero vector instead.
we use the bert-base-uncased model and the standard tokenizer.
thevalues of hyper-parameters are shown in table 2.for mrbert, we view the ways of componentrepresentation (start marker or averaged embed-ding, see section 3.1.2), relation modeling (lin-ear, bilinear, and neural tensor (nt)) models, seesection 3.2) and context integration (context con-catenation, average and maxout, see section 3.3).
strategies as hyper-parameters as well.
we runeach model for 10 epoches, and choose the bestcombination according to the performance on thedevelopment set.
the best combination uses theaveraged embeddings, the bilinear model and thecontext average strategy, and it will represent mr-bert for performance report in section 4.2..4.2 main results on vua dataset.
table 3 shows the results of the baselines and mr-bert.
except for (gao et al., 2018)-cls, all meth-ods use the annotation information of all tokens.
for the all-pos track, we report the performanceon either all pos tags or 4 main pos tags for com-parison with previous work..we can see that mrbert achieves superior orcompetitive performance compared with previouswork on verb metaphor detection.
the use of pre-trained language models improves the performancein general, compared with several lstm basedmethods.
recent proposed models, such as deep-met, melbert and mrbert, gain further improve-ments compared with bert-seq..mrbert outperforms (stowe et al., 2019)and (le et al., 2020) largely.
the two base-lines attempt to make use of grammar informa-tion, through data augmentation or graph neuralnetworks.
in contrast, mrbert provides a simpleyet effective way to incorporate verb arguments andnew contexts into a pre-trained language model..mrbert also has competitive performance com-pared with deepmet and melbert.
we share thesimilar idea to enhance interactions between thetarget verb and its contexts, but implement in differ-ent ways.
deepmet and melbert base on the pre-trained model roberta and use additional posor fgpos information.
moreover, these two mod-els are trained for every token so that the trainingmight be more sufﬁcient.
in contrast, we mainlymodel metaphorical relation for verbs.
this is per-haps also the reason that on the all-pos metaphordetection track, mrbert has slightly worse resultscompared with melbert.
however, our model isﬂexible and can be applied to tokens with otherpos tags as well.
we leave this as future work..4.3 analysis.
we further analyze the effects of modeling contex-tual relations from several aspects.

we can see thatmost combinations outperform bert-seq, andhave consistent performance.
the bilinear and neu-ral tensor models perform better than the linearmodel.
this means that sophisticated relation mod-elling techniques can beneﬁt the performance..context average and context maxout strategiesperform better than context concatenation.
thereason may be that context concatenation is moredifﬁcult to be trained due to more parameters.

ta-ble 6 shows the distribution of auto-extracted verb-subject and verb-direct object relations in the vuatest dataset.
∆f1 values indicate the improvementsof mrbert-g compared with bert-seq in f1.
we can see that mrbert-g outperforms bert-seq mainly when verb’s arguments are incom-plete.
for verbs with complete verb-subject andverb-direct object structures, little improvement isgained..table 7 shows the corresponding performance ofmrbert-gl.
better performance is obtained forverbs with all status of grammatical relations.
theimprovement on verbs in the lower right corneris obvious.
in these cases, the verbs are usuallyintransitive verbs or used as a noun or an adjective.
the beneﬁt of involving grammatical relations maybe that it helps keep a dynamic and balanced focusbetween the global and local contexts according tothe signals expressed by the grammatical structure.
intuitively, the effect of incorporating grammati-cal relations should be more obvious for metaphordetection in long sentences, since the local andglobal contexts are quite different.
to verify this,we divide sentences in the test dataset into bins.

this observation is consistentwith the conclusion of (choi et al., 2021).
it alsoindicates that the bert tokenizer’s embedding canbe used to approximate the representation of thetarget verb’s basic meaning..4.4 results on moh-x and trofi datasets.

the results means mrbert has good zero-shot transferability, although these datasets havequite different characteristics..in the 10-fold cross-validation setting, the re-trained mrbert can also obtain superior or com-petitive results compared with previous work.
ifwe continue to ﬁne-tune the pre-trained mrberton the target datasets, better performance can beobtained, especially on the moh-x dataset..table 8 shows the results on the moh-x and trofidatasets..5 related work.

metaphor detection is a key task in metaphor pro-cessing (veale et al., 2016).
it is typically viewedas a classiﬁcation problem.

next,we summarize data-driven methods from the per-spective of context types that have been explored.
grammatical relation-level detection thisline of work is to determine the metaphoricityof a given grammatical relation, such as verb-subject, verb-direct object or adjective-noun rela-tions (shutova et al., 2016).
the key to this cate-gory of work is to represent semantics and capturethe relation between the arguments..feature-based methods are based on hand-crafted linguistic features.
shutova and teufel(2010b) proposed to cluster nouns and verbs toconstruct semantic domains.
turney et al.
(2011)and shutova and sun (2013) considered the ab-stractness of concepts and context.
mohler et al.
(2013) exploited wikipedia and wordnet to builddomain signatures.
tsvetkov et al.
(2014) com-bined abstractness, imageability, supersenses, andcross-lingual features.
bulat et al.
(2017) exploitedattribute-based concept representations..the above handcrafted features heavily rely onlinguistic resources and expertise.
recently, dis-tributed representations are exploited for grammat-ical relation-level metaphor detection.
distributedword embeddings were used as features (tsvetkovet al., 2014) or to measure semantic related-ness (gutiérrez et al., 2016; mao et al., 2018).
vi-sual distributed representations were also provento be useful (shutova et al., 2016).
rei et al.
(2017) designed a supervised similarity networkto capture interactions between words.
song et al.
(2020) modeled metaphors as attribute-dependentdomain mappings and presented a knowledgegraph embedding approach for modeling nominalmetaphors.
zayed et al.
(2020) identiﬁed verb-nounand adjective-noun phrasal metaphoric expressionsby modeling phrase representations as a context..token-level detection another line of work for-mulates metaphor detection as a single token clas-siﬁcation or sequence labeling problem (do dinhand gurevych, 2016; gao et al., 2018; mao et al.,2019).
these approaches are mostly based on neu-ral network architectures and learn representationsin an end-to-end fashion.
these approaches dependon token-level human annotated datasets, such asthe widely used vua dataset (steen, 2010)..bilstm plus pre-trained word embeddings isone of the popular architectures for this task (gaoet al., 2018; mao et al., 2019).
recently, trans-former based pre-trained language models become.
the most popular architecture in the metaphor de-tection shared task (leong et al., 2020).
multi-task learning (dankers et al., 2019; rohanian et al.,2020; le et al., 2020; chen et al., 2020) and dis-course context (dankers et al., 2020) have beenexploited as well.
discussion the grammatical relation-level andtoken-level metaphor detection consider differentaspects of information.
grammatical relations in-corporate syntactic structures, which are well stud-ied in selectional preferences (wilks, 1975, 1978)and provide important clues for metaphor detection.
however, sentential context is also useful but is ig-nored.
in contrast, token-level metaphor detectionexplores wider context and gains improvements,but syntactic information is neglected and as dis-cussed in (zayed et al., 2020), interactions betweenmetaphor components are not explicitly modeled.
this paper aims to combine the grammaticalrelation-level, token-level and semantic-level infor-mation through pre-trained language model basedcontextual relation modeling..6 conclusion.
this paper presented the metaphor-relation bert(mrbert) model for verb metaphor detection.
wepropose a new view to formulate the task as mod-eling the metaphorical relation between the targetverb and its multiple context components, i.e., con-textual relations.
we propose and evaluate variousways to extract, model and integrate contextual re-lations for metaphoricity prediction.
we conductcomprehensive experiments on the vua dataset.
the evaluation shows that mrbert achieves su-perior or competitive performance compared withprevious methods.
we also observe that incorpo-rating grammatical relations can help balance localand global contexts, and the basic meaning of theverb as a distant context is effective.
further exper-iments on small datasets moh-x and trofi alsoshow good model transferability of mrbert..acknowledgments.
