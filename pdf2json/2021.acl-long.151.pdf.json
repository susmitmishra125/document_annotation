      "text" : "Pretrained language models and their corresponding contextualized representation spaces (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019) have recently been shown to encode and amplify a range of stereotypical human biases (e.g., gender or racial biases) (Zhao et al., 2019; Basta et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2020a,b), much like their static embedding pre-\ndecessors (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Dev and Phillips, 2019; Gonen and Goldberg, 2019; Lauscher et al., 2020a, inter alia). Having models that capture or even amplify human biases brings about further ethical challenges to the society (Henderson et al., 2018), since stereotyping minoritized groups is a representational harm that perpetuates societal inequalities and unfairness (Blodgett et al., 2020). Human biases are in all likelihood especially harmful if encoded in conversational AI systems, like the recent DialoGPT model (Zhang et al., 2020), which directly interact with humans, possibly even taking part in intimate and personal conversations (Utami et al., 2017).\nGiven the increasing presence of dialog systems and chatbots in everyday life, the body of work that focuses on detecting and mitigating biases in conversational systems is surprisingly limited (Lee et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020a,b; Dinan et al., 2020a,b), albeit some more research has recently emerged in the wider context of biases in generalpurpose language generation models (Qian et al., 2019; Sheng et al., 2019; Nadeem et al., 2020; Yeo and Chen, 2020). Most of these efforts 1) focus on a single bias dimension (predominantly gender bias), 2) operate on artificial data (i.e., not realworld dialog interactions), and – with the isolated exception of Liu et al. (2020b) – 3) completely neglect to analyze the potential effects of debiasing on model performance in dialog (sub-)tasks (e.g., dialog state tracking). In this work, we aim to close all these gaps by introducing REDDITBIAS, the first ’real-world’ data set for measuring and mitigating biases in dialog models, together with an evaluation framework that couples bias measures with downstream evaluation on dialog tasks.\nContributions. The contributions of this work are threefold: 1) we construct REDDITBIAS, a resource for multi-dimensional bias evaluation and\nmitigation dedicated to conversational AI. Unlike other bias evaluation resources, REDDITBIAS is created from real-world conversations collected from the popular online discussion platform Reddit and manually annotated for multiple societal bias dimensions: (i) religion, with two bias analysis subdimensions – (Jews, Christians) and (Muslims, Christians), (ii) race (African, American), (iii) gender (female, male), and (iv) queerness (LGBTQ, straight); 2) Along with the resource, we propose a dialog-oriented bias evaluation framework: it couples (i) a perplexity-based bias measure meant to quantify the amount of bias in generative language models with (ii) performance measures on two concrete downstream dialogue tasks – dialog state tracking (DST) and conversational response generation (CRG). Such a setup allows to test whether bias mitigation comes at the expense of deteriorated downstream dialog performance; 3) Finally, we adapt four bias mitigation methods from the literature and profile their debiasing and downstream effects on conversational language models with our evaluation framework. Acknowledging the conversational nature of REDDITBIAS, we resort to the recently proposed DialoGPT model (Zhang et al., 2020) for our comparative evaluation study. Our experimental results indicate that (i) DialoGPT is significantly biased along two (out of five) bias evaluation dimensions and (ii) that some of the employed debiasing methods (see §4) manage to reduce the bias, at the same time preserving DialoGPT’s conversational capabilities. We release REDDITBIAS together with all code online at: https://github.com/umanlp/RedditBias."

      "heading" : "2.1 Bias Specifications",
      "text" : "Unlike prior work, which mostly focuses on one or two bias dimensions, our study encompasses five types of bias from four dimensions: (1) religion (two different bias types), (2) race, (3) gender, and (4) queerness. To measure or mitigate a bias, one must first formalize (i.e., specify) it. To this end, we start from the concept of an\nexplicit bias specification (Caliskan et al., 2017; Lauscher et al., 2020a): an explicit bias specification BE = (T1, T2, A1, A2) consists of two sets of target terms or phrases T1 and T2 between which a bias is expected to exist w.r.t. two sets of attribute terms or phrases A1, and A2. Further, we opt for bias specifications that reflect the inequality between groups in power, i.e., dominant groups, and discriminated groups, i.e., minoritized groups:1 for each BE , the set T1 consists of terms describing a minoritized group with (negative) stereotypical terms inA1, while T2 consists of terms describing a dominant group with (positive) stereotypical terms in A2. We compile bias specifications as follows.\nThe two target lists T1 and T2 are created by manually compiling small sets of near-synonymous expressions that unambiguously refer to the minoritized and dominant groups, respectively (e.g., for dimension religion and Muslims as the minoritized group, we compile T1 = {muslims, arabs, islamic people, islam, islamic culture}). We then collect the list A1 of stereotypical negative descriptors by engaging with sociological literature relating to the minoritized groups (Welch, 2007; Shaw, 2012; Black, 2015).2 Finally, we create the corresponding list A2 of positive descriptors by looking for (loose) antonyms of expressions in A1 (e.g., if Jewish people ∈ T1 are stereotypically greedy ∈ A1, we would then place generous into A2). Note that designing bias specifications is a crucial step in most of the current debiasing approaches and that there exists a trade-off between employing a bigger set of specification terms and keeping the bias specifications clean. In this work, we generally focus on smaller and more precise term sets. We show partial term lists from our bias specifications in Table 1 and provide the full lists in the Appendix."

      "text" : "Starting from the compiled bias specifications, we next retrieve candidates for stereotypical comments from Reddit using the Pushshift API.3 To this end, we generate query strings by coupling each term from the target set T1 identifying the minoritized group with each term from the corresponding stereotypical attribute set A1 – this gives a query\n1We borrow the terminology (i.e., minoritized groups vs. dominant groups or groups in power) from the feminist discourse (e.g., D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020)\n2For example, Welch (2007) lists stereotypical negatives such as violent, drug dealer, or prison as strongly associated with African Americans.\n3https://pushshift.io/\nset Q = T1 × A1.4 We then run each query from Q against the API with a search period of 3.33 years. In a postprocessing step, we clean the retrieved data by removing URLs, user names, and extra white spaces and by lower-casing the comments. We retain only the retrieved comments that are shorter than 150 characters. In many cases we observed that, while comments as a whole are not biased, the part of the comment that connects t ∈ T1 and a ∈ A1, if taken out of context, is biased (e.g., “he just thinks all blacks are criminals”). To capture more biased phrases, we also extract a narrower context of +/− 7 tokens from the target term t ∈ T1. We then annotate for bias both (1) the whole comment and (2) this narrower context window around the target term extracted from the comment (as a standalone text)."

      "text" : "The last step in the creation of REDDITBIAS is manually annotating for bias both retrieved comments and their corresponding target word contexts\n4To increase the likelihood that retrieved comments do express the bias of interest, we couple T1 terms with correct forms of the verb to be (e.g., jews are instead of jews or husband is instead of husband), as such phrases are more likely to introduce a biased statement.\n(i.e., phrases). Human annotators then assign a binary label indicating if a negative stereotypical bias is expressed to each comment and each corresponding phrase.5 After an initial training of the annotators, we first carried out a small calibration study during which we refined the annotation guidelines6 and identified corner cases, e.g., comments involving sarcasm or comments quoting an earlier (biased) comment. We then split all the retrieved candidate comments for all five bias types between the three annotators (without overlap) and let them carry out the annotation work. Table 3 reveals the total number of annotated and positive (i.e., biased) instances at the comment and phrase level for each of the five bias types.\nFinally, we measure the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) by letting an additional annotator7 label 100 randomly selected candidates for biased comments (20 per each of the five bias types). We measure an IAA of .65 Krippendorff’s α (nominal) on the comment level and .67 on the phrase\n5We hired three annotators with diverse gender and diverse religious and cultural backgrounds; they all have an University degree in Computer Science and speak English fluently.\n6The final version of the annotation guidelines is available in the Appendix.\n7A doctoral student in NLP.\nlevel. We did not observe significant differences in agreement across the individual bias types. For the purposes of training and evaluating bias mitigation methods (which we adapt from the literature for conversational LMs in §4), we split the obtained biased phrases into train, development, and test portions; their sizes are also shown in Table 3. We further show examples of comments labeled as biased for all five bias types in Table 2."

To this end, we start from a bias specification BE = (T1, T2, A1, A2) and a set of the corresponding biased phrases X(T1,A1) from the test portion of REDDITBIAS related to this bias dimension. We first build pairs of corresponding terms between the {t1, t2} ⊂ T1 × T2.8 We list all pairs in the Appendix. We then follow the principle of counterfactual data augmentation (Zhao et al., 2018) and for each biased phrase x(t1,a1) ∈ X(T1,A1) (e.g., “everyone knows jews are greedy”) create a corresponding inversely biased phrase x̂(t2,a1) (e.g., “everyone knows christians are greedy”).

Our bias measure relies on the significance of mean perplexity differences between biased expressions x(i)(t1,a1) and their counterfactual counterparts x̂(i)(t2,a1). Since the reliability of such significance may be negatively affected by outliers (Pollet and van der Meij, 2017), we first reduce noise by removing pairs in which either x(i)(t1,a1) or x̂ (i) (t2,a1)\nhave very high perplexity, i.e., if they are not within the interval ∈ [(x̄+ 3 · s), (x̄− 3 · s)], where x̄ is the mean perplexity of the sample and s the corresponding standard deviation. Finally, we quantify and report the bias effect as the t-value of the Student’s two-tailed test between two ordered sets of corresponding perplexity scores – PP(X(T1,A1)) and PP(X̂(T2,A1)) – obtained after eliminating the outlier pairs. In this setup, a negative t value indicates the presence of a (negative) stereotypical bias. The bias is then statistically significant if the corresponding p-value of the test is within the given confidence interval (in this study set to α = 0.05)."

As input to DialogGPT, we concatenate the tokens from (i) the previous system output, (ii) the current user utterance, and (iii) the MultiWoZ domain, the slot, and value tokens.

We compute this loss in two steps: (1) identification of the bias subspace, and (2) neutralization of the attribute words w.r.t. to the previously identified bias subspace.\n(1) Bias Subspace Identification. We start from the same set of manually curated target term pairs P as in LMD and ADD. Let t be the output vector of some term t from the LM head. We then obtain partial bias vectors bi for pairs (t1i, t2i) ∈ P by computing the differences between t1i and t2i: bi = (t1i − t2i)/2. We then stack the partial bias vectors bi to form a matrix C. The bias subspace B then consists of the top k columns of V, obtained via SVD of C (i.e., SVD(C) = UΣV>), with k as the smallest number of singular values that explain at least 50% of the variance of the squared Frobenius norm of the matrix C.\n(2) Attribute Neutralization. In the second step, we neutralize the contextualized representations of attributes a ∈ A1 with respect to the bias subspace B computed in the first step.

We again start from the manually created set of paired terms P = {(t1i, t2i)}i ⊂ T1 × T2. For each utterance in the training portion of REDDITBIAS which contains an association between t1i ∈ T1 and a ∈ A1 (e.g., “that Muslim is dangerous”) we create a corresponding counterfactual utterance by replacing t1i with its pair t2i (e.g., “that Christian is dangerous”).

As shown in Figure 1a, according to our stereotypical bias measure (LMB), the original DialoGPT model still exhibits significant bias along the dimension of religion, for both Religion #1 (jews, christians), and Religion #2 (muslims, christians), despite the reported heuristic removal of offensive language from the pretraining data (Zhang et al., 2020). This is most likely due to the more subtle nature of religious stereotypes, which manifest themselves not only in openly offensive text but also in latent co-occurrences of target and attribute terms (e.g., Islam being radical or Jews playing violins). The bias effect for the Gender dimension is also in the stereotypical direction (i.e., the t-value is negative), but the effect size is insignificant. For Race and Queerness, DialoGPT exhibits insignificant bias effects in the direction opposite from the stereotypical one. We believe that the biases in these two dimensions are most frequently associated with explicit and offensive language, much of which was eliminated in DialoGPT’s preprocessing.\nFor the two Religion bias types, in which DialoGPT exhibits significant biases, only two of the four debiasing methods – HD and CDA – are able to remove the stereotypical bias for both bias specifications statistically significantly. LMD and ADD each make the bias insignificant only in one of two cases (LMD for Religion #2, ADD for Religion #1), although they do attenuate the original bias effect for the other specification as well.\nInterestingly, for the dimensions in which DialoGPT does not exhibit significant stereotypical bias in the first place (Race, Gender, Orientation), all four debiasing methods tend to lead to an antistereotypical bias effect, i.e., to more strongly (and in a few cases statistically significantly) associated negative stereotypical attributes with the dominant group. For example, criminal gets associated with caucasian, nurse with father or sinful with heterosexual). This finding stresses the utmost impor-\ntance of measuring bias effects before and after applying debiasing procedures on any LMs.\nDownstream Dialog Performance. Encouragingly, none of the four debiasing methods in our study seem to diminish DialoGPT’s capabilities in downstream dialog tasks – DST and response generation (see Tables 4 and 5).15 Interestingly, while LMD drastically increases the perplexity on Reddit utterances (Figure 1b; see LMP in §3) this does not have negative consequences on DST and CRG.\nTo summarize, from the benchmarked debiasing methods, HD and CDA are able to significantly reduce the bias and preserve conversational capabilities; Our results suggest that the dialog performance would remain unaffected even if HD and CDA are to be applied more than once, in order to mitigate multiple bias types."

Dialog systems crucially depend on natural language generation (NLG) models. Yeo and Chen (2020) experimented with gender bias in word embeddings for NLG. Sheng et al. (2019) introduce the notion of a regard for a demographic, and compile a data set and devise a bias classification model based on that notion. Webster et al. (2020) proposed Discovery of Correlation (DisCo), a template-based method for gender bias detection which considers an LM’s three highest-ranked predictions for a blank text position. Nadeem et al. (2020) intro-\nduce StereoSet, a crowdsourced data set for associative contexts at two levels (intra-sentence and intersentence) for four bias dimensions. Nangia et al. (2020) present CrowS-Pairs, a data set for measuring bias in masked LMs focusing on nine bias types. However, they don’t measure task-oriented model performance, which may degrade as a result of the debiasing procedure (Lauscher et al., 2020a). Qian et al. (2019) reduce gender bias in recurrent LMs with a loss function based on HD (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) – we adapt this method for debiasing conversational LMs (see §4).\n(3) Bias in Dialog. The landscape of research on bias in dialog systems is scarce: the existing efforts mostly focus on measuring and mitigating gender bias only and do not measure downstream dialog performance of debiased models. Dinan et al. (2020b) focus on multi-dimensional gender bias classification and controlled mitigation. Dinan et al. (2020a) analyze existing dialog data sets for gender bias and extend LIGHT (Urbanek et al., 2019), a resource for grounded dialog, with crowdsourced gender-balanced utterances. Both Lee et al. (2019) and Liu et al. (2020a) add racial bias as a second dimension for bias analysis of dialog models. While Lee et al. (2019) classify whether chatbots agree or disagree with stereotypical statements, Liu et al. (2020a) explore several measures for evaluating bias in dialog systems, including diversity in response generation – this is similar to the work of Liu et al. (2020b) who also include generation quality measures. Overall, these efforts focus only on the two bias dimensions (gender and race) and fail to thoroughly analyze the effects of debiasing on performance in dialog tasks such as slot-value extraction, DST, and CRG which are paramount in task-oriented dialog systems."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "Stereotypical societal biases may lead to the generation of unfair and unethical responses in dialog systems. We presented REDDITBIAS, a comprehensive resource for bias evaluation and debiasing of conversational LMs. Consisting of manuallyannotated biased comments from Reddit, REDDITBIAS is the first real-world resource dedicated to multi-dimensional analysis (gender, race, religion, queerness) of biases in dialog models. We benchmarked the well-known DialogGPT on REDDITBIAS and analyzed the effects that different debiasing methods (adapted from previous work) have on\nit. Despite dedicated bias mitigation preprocessing of DialogGPT’s pretraining data, it still exhibits prominent religious biases. The benchmarked debiasing methods, however, mostly manage to mitigate those biases, while at the same time retaining the model performance in dialog-oriented downstream tasks (e.g., dialog state tracking). We hope that REDDITBIAS catalyzes research efforts on fair and ethical dialog systems and conversational AI."

      "heading" : "Further Ethical Considerations",
      "text" : "Acknowledging the ethical dimension of our work, we like to point the reader to the following limitations and potential implications.\n(i) Gender is a spectrum and we fully acknowledge the importance of the inclusion of all gender identities, e.g., nonbinary, gender fluid, polygender, etc. in language technologies. Note that in our gender bias specification, however, we follow a more classic notion in-line with our focus on the discrepancy between a dominant and a minoritized group. We capture gender identities beyond the binary conception in our LGBTQ bias specification under the notion of queerness.\n(ii) Similarly important is the intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1989) of stereotyping due to the individual composition and interaction of identity chracteristics, e.g., social class and gender (Degaetano-Ortlieb, 2018). Due to its complexity, we do not address the topic in this work.\n(iii) As we demonstrate in our work, debiasing technologies can, beyond its intended use, be used to increase bias and create biased models. We think that this finding stresses our responsibility to reach out and to raise awareness w.r.t. the impact of language technology among decision makers and users, to establish a broader discourse, and to include ethical aspects in current data science curricula (Bender et al., 2020)."

Recent work has predominantly focused on measuring and mitigating bias in pretrained language models. Surprisingly, the landscape of bias measurements and mitigation resources and methods for conversational language models is still very scarce: it is limited to only a few types of bias, artificially constructed resources, and completely ignores the impact that debiasing methods may have on the final performance in dialog tasks, e.g., conversational response generation. In this work, we present REDDITBIAS, the first conversational data set grounded in the actual human conversations from Reddit, allowing for bias measurement and mitigation across four important bias dimensions: gender, race, religion, and queerness. Further, we develop an evaluation framework which simultaneously 1) measures bias on the developed REDDITBIAS resource, and 2) evaluates model capability in dialog tasks after model debiasing. We use the evaluation framework to benchmark the widely used conversational DialoGPT model along with the adaptations of four debiasing methods. Our results indicate that DialoGPT is biased with respect to religious groups and that some debiasing techniques can remove this bias while preserving downstream task performance.",
