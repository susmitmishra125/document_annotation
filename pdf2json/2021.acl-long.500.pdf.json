      "text" : "Significant advances have been witnessed in many NLG tasks with pretraining models (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). However, existing generation models are still far behind the human-level performance to generate reasonable texts, particularly for open-ended generation tasks such as story generation (Fan et al., 2018; Guan et al., 2020). One critical obstacle is the lack of powerful metrics for measuring the quality of generation.\n∗Corresponding author\nThe standard paradigm for evaluating NLG metrics is to calculate the correlation with human judgments on manually annotated datasets (Tao et al., 2018; Sellam et al., 2020). Recent studies have discovered that the existing automatic metrics may correlate poorly with human judgments (Liu et al., 2016; Guan and Huang, 2020). Unfortunately, the lack of benchmark datasets makes it challenging to completely assess the capabilities of a metric and fairly compare different metrics. Firstly, annotated datasets usually contain innate data bias and annotation bias. Secondly, summarizing the performance with a single aggregate statistic (e.g., a correlation score) makes it difficult to probe which aspects a metric can successfully capture and which can not. Therefore, many alternative approaches have been proposed to evaluate NLG metrics, such as measuring the robustness to adversarial examples (Zhang* et al., 2020), and the generalization to quality-biased data (Sellam et al., 2020). However, these approaches only focus on an individual capability or a single task, thereby failing to fully reveal the strengths and weaknesses of a NLG metric.\nTherefore, we propose OpenMEVA, a benchmark for Open-ended story generation Metrics Evaluation. We first collect a MANually annotated Story dataset (MANS). The stories are generated by various generation models trained on two widely used story corpora, ROCStories (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016) and WritingPrompts (Fan et al., 2018). Therefore, MANS supports to evaluate metrics in terms of not only the correlation with human judgments, but also the generalization w.r.t model drift (generations from different models) and dataset drift (examples from different datasets).\nIn addition, OpenMEVA also includes an AUTOconstructed Story dataset (AUTOS) to test the robustness and the ability to judge story coherence, namely, the semantic relations and discourse structures in the context. We construct AUTOS by per-\nturbing human-written stories, and test the metrics in each single aspect (e.g., the ability to recognize inconsistency) by validating the input-output behavior (Ribeiro et al., 2020). Through such behavioral tests, AUTOS can support to reveal potential issues of metrics in multiple aspects, which would be not traceable in machine-generated examples in MANS.\nWe conduct extensive experiments to assess the capabilities of existing automatic metrics on OpenMEVA. We find that state-of-the-art metrics still correlate poorly (less than 0.5) with human judgments on MANS. And it is difficult for the learnable metrics to generalize to model or dataset drift. Through tests on AUTOS, we observe that most metrics can perform well in recognizing incoherence at token level (e.g., unrelated entities) and sentence level (e.g., semantic repetition), but fail to recognize discourse-level incoherence (e.g., inconsistency) and lack understanding of inferential knowledge (e.g., temporal order between events). Besides, we also show that existing metrics are not robust to a small number of typos and synonym substitution. These findings may inspire new directions for developing NLG models and designing metrics in future research.\nWe also provide an open-source toolkit which implements various metrics, and therefore supports the comparison and analysis of metrics. In addition, the toolkit provides data perturbation techniques for generating customized test cases beyond AUTOS, which can facilitate fast development of new automatic metrics1."

      "text" : "Various automatic metrics have been proposed for evaluating language generation. They can be roughly divided into referenced, unreferenced, and hybrid metrics, according to whether relying on human-written references when calculating the metric score. Referenced metrics usually measure the similarity between a sample and some references based on word-overlap (e.g., BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004)) or word embedding (e.g., BERTScore (Zhang* et al., 2020), MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019)). However, referenced metrics were reported to correlate poorly with human judgments in open-ended generation tasks (Liu et al., 2016) due to the one-to-many issue (Zhao et al., 2017). To address the issue, un-\n1All the tools, data, and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/thu-coai/OpenMEVA\nreferenced metrics were proposed to measure the quality of a sample without any reference, such as perplexity, discriminator-based metric (Kannan and Vinyals, 2017), UNION (Guan and Huang, 2020) and GRADE (Huang et al., 2020). Besides, hybrid metrics combine referenced and unreferenced metrics (e.g., RUBER and its variant (Tao et al., 2018; Ghazarian et al., 2019)) or learn from the human-annotated score (e.g., ADEM (Lowe et al., 2017), BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020)).\nRecently, there have been many criticisms for existing metrics. Garbacea et al. (2019) showed the poor generalization of discriminator-based metrics. Sai et al. (2019) demonstrated ADEM is not robust to simple attacks such as simple word substitution or random word shuffle. However, these criticisms only focus on individual metrics or capabilities. Notably, Ribeiro et al. (2020) proposed a framework CheckList to evaluate different capabilities of general language understanding models by validating the input-output behavior. The test cases are created from scratch or by perturbing an existing dataset. Similar to Checklist, OpenMEVA also employs automatically constructing examples for behavioral tests. However, CheckList only focuses on single sentences, thereby lacking the ability to test models in understanding long texts with many discourse-level features (e.g., temporal relationship). Moreover, the testing methods of CheckList are not directly applicable for NLG metrics. Specifically, CheckList measures the performance of a model by calculating the failure rate between discrete model prediction and automatic labels. Such failure rates are ineffective for measuring metrics since most metric scores are continuous. To address the above issues, we propose perturbation techniques and testing methods more applicable for story generation metrics."

ROC contains 98,162 five-sentence commonsense stories with about 50 words, while WP consists of 303,358 pairs of prompts and stories, which are usually unconstrained on writing topics. We retain about 250 words (with correct sentence boundary) for stories\nin WP. Although we only consider the stories in the two corpora, OpenMEVA is designed to measure the capability of NLG metrics to evaluate general linguistic features such as coherence, which may pertain to other stories. Besides, our idea that building datasets by manual annotation or automatic construction can be easily extended to evaluate specific aspects for other types of stories."

      "text" : "We collect MANS to assess the correlation of metrics with human judgments and the generalization ability when evaluating machine-generated stories. We randomly split ROC and WP by 90%/5%/5% for training/validation/test of the generation models. We regard the first sentence for ROC and the prompt for WP as input. After training, we generate stories based on the test sets. Then, we resort to Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for human judgments of the generated stories. We consider various generation models including a Seq2Seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014), Fusion (Fan et al., 2018), Plan&Write (Yao et al., 2019), the fine-tuned GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and KnowledGe-enhanced GPT-2 (Guan et al., 2020). These models cover diverse network architectures and different levels of the generation ability, which support to evaluate the generalization to examples with different model biases or quality levels.\nManual Annotation We present the manual annotation interface in Figure 1. In each human intelligence task (HIT) of AMT, we show workers the input of a story paired with seven stories including (a) five stories generated by the above five models, (b) the human-written story, and (c) a negative example constructed by perturbing a story (e.g., repetition, shuffling) sampled from the test sets.\nThen we ask workers to compare the overall quality of the seven stories2, and rate each story with a 5-point Likert scale. We reject an HIT if the worker rates the human-written story lower than four points or rates the negative example higher than two points. Through the quality control mechanism, we filtered about 38.7% assignments for ROC and 75.4% for WP. Finally, we ensure that there are five valid ratings for each generated story, and we regard the average rating as the final human judgment.\nConsidering that overall quality is often too abstract to measure, we follow previous recommendations (Belz and Hastie, 2014; van der Lee et al., 2020) to decide the overall quality by summarizing multiple separate criteria. We ask the workers to decide the rating of a story based on a point deduction policy. Specifically, a story should get punishment in points if it contains errors such as repetitive plots, unrelated events and conflicting logic, or globally chaotic scenes, which are commonly observed in existing NLG models (Guan and Huang, 2020) (several examples shown in the appendix). Intuitively, the policy can alleviate the tendency to give high scores and ensure that the judgment standard of workers is as consistent as possible during annotation. To avoid introducing extra bias in the policy, we do not impose the restriction on workers to exactly match the rating in overall quality with the deducted points.\nData Statistics We randomly sampled 200 stories from test sets of ROC and WP for story\n2We do not ask annotation in other aspects (e.g., interesting) since previous work (Novikova et al., 2017) has noted that the annotation scores on different aspects are highly correlated in spite of careful design.

Therefore, MANS contains 2 × 200 × 5 = 2, 000 annotated machinegenerated stories, paired with corresponding inputs and human-written references. The Krippendorff’s α (Krippendorff, 2018) of the human judgments is 0.77/0.71 for ROC/WP, indicating a moderate inter-annotator agreement (α ∈ [0.67, 0.8]). We show more statistical details in the appendix."

      "text" : "While improving correlation with human judgments is the ultimate goal for developing automatic metrics, merely relying on limited annotated data may make the true evaluation performance overestimated (Ribeiro et al., 2020). Besides, a machine-\ngenerated story may contain multiple entangled errors (e.g., repetition, unrelatedness), which do not support individual tests for metrics. Therefore, we propose to evaluate the capabilities of metrics with auto-constructed test examples (i.e., AUTOS), each of which is created to focus on a single aspect. We construct AUTOS based on the human-written stories in the test sets of ROC and WP.\nAspects We argue that an ideal metric for evaluating open-ended language generation should have at least the following capabilities: (a) the ability to judge story coherence, which requires recognizing lexical and semantic repetition, unreasonable character behavior (e.g., chaotic coreferences), violation of common sense (e.g., “trick or treat” on “Christmas”), poor consistency and relatedness, incorrect causal and temporal relationship; and (b) the robustness to perturbations, such as substituting with synonyms or paraphrases, deleting unimportant punctuation marks, contracting\n2We generate paraphrases based on the back translation augmentation system of UDA (Xie et al., 2020).\n3ConceptNet is a knowledge base including millions of commonsense triples like (h, r, t), meaning that the head entity h has a relation r with the tail entity t. Note that we only regard nouns and verbs as entities.\n4We regard the stories with maximum inter-sentence MoverScore less than 0.1 as those which have weak tokenlevel semantic relatedness within the context.\nfull expressions or expanding contractions, and adding typos. Tests in these aspects require metrics to fully understand the linguistic features at token level (e.g., synonyms), sentence level (e.g., semantic similarity), and discourse level (e.g., context relatedness in content and proper sentence orders), and possess knowledge about common sense, causality, etc., which are usually not traceable in machine-generated stories. Although these aspects are not exhaustive, it is a starting point for further research. Table 1 and 2 present some examples for the two capabilities, respectively.\nTest Types We create examples with different test types to evaluate the above capabilities of metrics. Firstly, we evaluate the ability to judge story coherence by the discrimination test, which requires metrics to distinguish human-written coherent examples from incoherent ones. We create each incoherent example by applying perturbation within a single aspect. Besides, we also select different human-written stories as coherent examples for different aspects, as shown in Table 1. For robustness assessment, we expect the metric scores to remain the same with certain perturbations, i.e., the invariance test, as shown in Table 2.\nHowever, the perturbation may inevitably introduce grammar errors. To alleviate the issue, we filter out those ungrammatical examples in AUTOS except for those used to evaluate robustness to typos using an automatic grammaticality classifier. We present the statistics of AUTOS together with the evaluation results in Table 6/ 7 for the discrimination/invariance tests, respectively. And we provide more details about the construction of AUTOS and the grammaticality classifier in the appendix."

Besides, we also evaluate metrics on the other four evaluation sets constructed for individual error types (described in Section 3.1) based on MANS. Each of them contains all the reasonable samples and the unreasonable samples of some error type. A reasonable sample means its overall quality score larger than four points. For an unreasonable sample, we decide it is of some error type if there is only one error type annotated by at least three of five annotators. We assign the reasonable and unreasonable samples with binary labels 1 and 0, respectively, and calculate the correlation between metric scores and the binary labels on the four evaluation sets.\nWe summarize the correlation results in Table 3. As previous studies (Guan and Huang, 2020) observed, unreferenced metrics are more competitive for evaluating open-ended language generation than referenced ones. PPL (F) performs better than PPL (P) on ROC but not on WP, which may be because stories in ROC are created artificially and hence differ from the general language distribution during pretraining GPT-2. Furthermore, measuring input-output relatedness (Ru-BERT) is not enough for language generation evaluation. UNION outperforms other metrics in overall quality assessment since it learns to distinguish human-written stories from negative samples with more error types. Interestingly, it seems easier for the metrics to recognize surface errors (e.g., repetitive plots) or serious global errors (e.g., chaotic scenes). However, the best correlation with human judgments is still fairly low, and it is difficult to recognize unrelatedness and conflicting plot.

However, both an insignificant drop and improvement in a metric could correspond to a significant improvement in human judgments. And worse, the improvement in human judgments may have a wide range, which is particularly evident for BERTScore-F1 and RUBER-BERT (yellow/light gray part in Figure 2). That is, if an NLG model achieves insignificantly better scores in the two metrics, it is quite possible that the model performs significantly worse in human judgments.

The higher correlation means the better ability to judge coherence.\nTable 6 presents the correlation results. We summarize the results as follows: (1) PPL is ineffective to recognize repetition errors. The observation is accordant with the results on MANS (Table 3). PPL (P) even has a significantly negative correlation with labels in lexical and semantic repetition. (2) PPL (F) and UNION have better average performance than others. Ru-BERT performs worst in almost all the aspects. UNION has the highest average performance by a large margin on ROC but underperforms PPL (F) on WP, indicating the shortage of UNION when evaluating longer stories. Besides, the results show that a powerful language model may also be a powerful evaluator (if we can alleviate its preference for repetitive texts). (3) Existing metrics perform well in recognizing incoherence at token and sentence levels. For example, they seem to be able to recognize unreasonable behavior for a certain character, and possess some commonsense knowledge about entity relations. However, in this work the proposed perturbation can not fully cover all possible incoherence in these aspects, which would be regarded as the future work. (4) The metrics still struggle to recognize discourse-level incoherence. Specifically, it is difficult to recognize inconsistent events when we insert or delete negated words, and understand the semantic relatedness across sentences. Besides, they also lack inferential knowledge about the causal and temporal relationship. The observations are also accordant with the results in Table 3 where unrelated events and conflicting logic can not be well recognized. In conclusion, we reveal various issues of the existing metrics by the isolating behavioral testing, while they achieve moderate correlation with human judgments on MANS.\n8It is meaningless to evaluate referenced or hybrid metrics on AUTOS since the reference text of a positive example is exactly itself, which is an unfair case for unreferenced metrics."

However, they are very sensitive to a small number of typos (less than 2% words) because typos may bring some out-of-vocabulary words.

The classifier is fine-tuned on the CoLA corpus based on BERT and achieves an accuracy of 82.90% on the test set of CoLA. Furthermore, if we suppose that all of the human-written stories in ROC and WP are grammatical, the accuracy of the classifier on the stories would be 96.48% and 65.68% for ROC and WP, respectively. The results are intuitive since stories in WP may contain much informal English (e.g., website link). We present several examples in Table 15 to further indicate the usefulness of the classifier. We can see that the classifier can detect the grammar errors in multiple aspects such as verb forms (e.g., “head” should be “heads” for case 1) and sentence elements (e.g., the predicate is missing for case 3). And the classifier would give the grammatical sentences high scores although they may be unreasonable in logic (e.g., repetitive texts for case 4 and conflicting plot for case 5). Finally, we filter out about 21.69% and 50.15% examples for ROC/WP, respectively."

However, existing automatic metrics are observed to correlate poorly with human evaluation. The lack of standardized benchmark datasets makes it difficult to fully evaluate the capabilities of a metric and fairly compare different metrics. Therefore, we propose OpenMEVA, a benchmark for evaluating open-ended story generation metrics. OpenMEVA provides a comprehensive test suite to assess the capabilities of metrics, including (a) the correlation with human judgments, (b) the generalization to different model outputs and datasets, (c) the ability to judge story coherence, and (d) the robustness to perturbations. To this end, OpenMEVA includes both manually annotated stories and auto-constructed test examples. We evaluate existing metrics on OpenMEVA and observe that they have poor correlation with human judgments, fail to recognize discourselevel incoherence, and lack inferential knowledge (e.g., causal order between events), the generalization ability and robustness. Our study presents insights for developing NLG models and metrics in further research.",
