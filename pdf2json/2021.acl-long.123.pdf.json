      "text" : "Utterance-level emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is an emerging task that aims to identify the emotion of each utterance in a conversation. This task has been recently concerned by a considerable number of NLP researchers due to its potential applications in several areas, such as opinion mining in social media (Chatterjee et al., 2019) and building an emotional and empathetic dialog system (Majumder et al., 2020).\nThe emotion of a query utterance is likely to be influenced by many factors such as the utterances spoken by the same speaker and the surrounding conversation context. Indeed, how to model the conversational context lies at the heart of this task (Poria et al., 2019a). Empirical evidence also shows\n∗Corresponding author. 1The code is available at https://github.com/\nshenwzh3/DAG-ERC\nthat a good representation of conversation context significantly contributes to the model performance, especially when the content of query utterance is too short to be identified alone (Ghosal et al., 2019).\nNumerous efforts have been devoted to the modeling of conversation context. Basically, they can be divided into two categories: graph-based methods (Zhang et al., 2019a; Ghosal et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2019; Ishiwatari et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020) and recurrence-based methods (Hazarika et al., 2018a; Hazarika et al., 2018b; Majumder et al., 2019; Ghosal et al., 2020). For the graphbased methods, they concurrently gather information of the surrounding utterances within a certain window, while neglecting the distant utterances and the sequential information. For the recurrencebased methods, they consider the distant utterances and sequential information by encoding the utterances temporally. However, they tend to update the query utterance’s state with only relatively limited information from the nearest utterances, making them difficult to get a satisfying performance.\nAccording to the above analysis, an intuitively better way to solve ERC is to allow the advantages of graph-based methods and recurrence-based models to complement each other. This can be achieved by regarding each conversation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). As illustrated in Figure 1, each utterance in a conversation only receives information from some previous utterances and cannot propagate information backward to itself and its predecessors through any path. This characteristic indicates that a conversation can be regarded as a DAG. Moreover, by the information flow from predecessors to successors through edges, DAG can gather information for a query utterance from both the neighboring utterances and the remote utterances, which acts like a combination of graph structure and recurrence structure. Thus, we speculate that DAG is a more appropriate and reasonable way than graph-based structure and recurrence-based structure to model the conversation context in ERC.\nIn this paper, we propose a method to model the conversation context in the form of DAG. Firstly, rather than simply connecting each utterance with a fixed number of its surrounding utterances to build a graph, we propose a new way to build a DAG from the conversation with constraints on speaker identity and positional relations. Secondly, inspired by DAGNN (Thost and Chen, 2021), we propose a directed acyclic graph neural network for ERC, namely DAG-ERC. Unlike the traditional graph neural networks such as GCN (Kipf and Welling, 2016) and GAT (Veličković et al., 2017) that aggregate information from the previous layer, DAGERC can recurrently gather information of predecessors for every utterance in a single layer, which enables the model to encode the remote context without having to stack too many layers. Besides, in order to be more applicable to the ERC task, our DAG-ERC has two improvements over DAGNN: (1) a relation-aware feature transformation to gather information based on speaker identity and (2) a contextual information unit to enhance the information of historical context. We conduct extensive experiments on four ERC benchmarks and the results show that the proposed DAG-ERC achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, several studies are conducted to explore the effect of the proposed DAG structure and the modules of DAG-ERC.\nThe contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we are the first to consider a conversation\nas a directed acyclic graph in the ERC task. Second, we propose a method to build a DAG from a conversation with constraints based on the speaker identity and positional relations. Third, we propose a directed acyclic graph neural network for ERC, which takes DAGNN as its backbone and has two main improvements designed specifically for ERC."

      "text" : "Recently, several ERC datasets with textual data have been released (Busso et al., 2008; Schuller et al., 2012; Zahiri and Choi, 2017; Li et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Poria et al., 2019b), arousing the widespread interest of NLP researchers. In the following paragraphs, we divide the related works into two categories according to the methods they use to model the conversation context. Graph-based Models DialogGCN (Ghosal et al., 2019) treats each dialog as a graph in which each utterance is connected with the surrounding utterances. RGAT (Ishiwatari et al., 2020) adds positional encodings to DialogGCN. ConGCN (Zhang et al., 2019a) regards both speakers and utterances as graph nodes and makes the whole ERC dataset a single graph. KET (Zhong et al., 2019) uses hierarchical Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) with external knowledge. DialogXL (Shen et al., 2020) improves XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) with enhanced memory and dialog-aware self-attention.2 Recurrence-based Models In this category, ICON (Hazarika et al., 2018a) and CMN (Hazarika et al., 2018b) both utilize gated recurrent unit (GRU) and memory networks. HiGRU (Jiao et al., 2019) contains two GRUs, one for utterance encoder and the other for conversation encoder. DialogRNN (Majumder et al., 2019) is a recurrence-based method that models dialog dynamics with several RNNs. COSMIC (Ghosal et al., 2020) is the latest model, which adopts a network structure very close to DialogRNN and adds external commonsense knowledge to improve performance."

A number of neural networks that employ DAG architecture have been proposed, such as Tree-LSTM (Tai et al., 2015), DAG-RNN(Shuai et al., 2016), D-VAE (Zhang et al., 2019b), and DAGNN (Thost and Chen, 2021). DAGNN is different from the previous DAG models in the model structure. Specifically, DAGNN allows multiple layers to be stacked, while the others have only one single layer. Besides, instead of merely carrying out naive sum or element-wise product on the predecessors’ representations, DAGNN conducts information aggregation using graph attention."

The speaker identity is denoted by a function p(·). For example, p(ui) ∈ P denotes the speaker of ui and P is the collection of all speaker roles in an ERC dataset.

      "text" : "We design a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the information propagation in a conversation. A DAG is denoted by G = (V, E ,R). In this paper, the nodes in the DAG are the utterances in the conversation, i.e., V = {u1, u2, ..., uN}, and the edge (i, j, rij) ∈ E represents the information propagated from ui to uj , where rij ∈ R is the relation type of the edge. The set of relation types of edges, R = {0, 1}, contains two types of relation: 1 for that the two connected utterances are spoken by the same speaker, and 0 for otherwise.\nWe impose three constraints to decide when an utterance would propagate information to another, i.e., when two utterances are connected in the DAG: Direction: ∀j > i, (j, i, rji) /∈ E . A previous utterance can pass message to a future utterance, but a future utterance cannot pass message backwards. Remote information: ∃τ < i, p(uτ )=p(ui), (τ, i , rτi) ∈ E and ∀j < τ, (j, i, rji) /∈ E . For each utterance ui except the first one, there is a previous utterance uτ that is spoken by the same speaker as\nAlgorithm 1 Building a DAG from a Conversation Input: the dialog {u1, u2, ..., uN}, speaker iden-\ntity p(·), hyper-parameter ω Output: G = (V, E ,R)\n1: V ← {u1, u2, ..., uN} 2: E ← ∅ 3: R ← {0, 1} 4: for all i ∈ {2, 3, ..., N} do 5: c← 0 6: τ ← i− 1 7: while τ > 0 and c < ω do 8: if p(uτ ) = p(ui) then 9: E ← E ∪ {(τ, i, 1)}\n10: c← c+ 1 11: else 12: E ← E ∪ {(τ, i, 0)} 13: end if 14: τ ← τ − 1 15: end while 16: end for 17: return G = (V, E ,R)\nui. The information generated before uτ is called remote information, which is relatively less important. We assume that when the speaker speaks uτ , she/he has been aware of the remote information before uτ . That means, uτ has included the remote information and it will be responsible for propagating the remote information to ui. Local information: ∀l, τ < l < i, (l, i, rli) ∈ E . Usually, the information of the local context is important. Consider uτ and ui defined in the second constraint. We assume that every utterance ul in between uτ and ui contains local information, and they will propagate the local information to ui.\nThe first constraint ensures the conversation to be a DAG, and the second and third constraints indicate that uτ is the cut-off point of remote and local information. We regard uτ as the ω-th latest utterance spoken by p(ui) before ui, where ω is a hyper-parameter. Then for each utterance ul in between uτ and ui, we make a directed edge from ul to ui. We show the above process of building a DAG in Algorithm 1.\nAn example of the DAG is shown in Figure 2. In general, our DAG has two main advancements compared to the graph structures developed in previous works (Ghosal et al., 2019; Ishiwatari et al., 2020): First, our DAG doesn’t have edges from future utterances to previous utterances, which we\nargue is more reasonable and realistic, as the emotion of a query utterance should not be influenced by the future utterances in practice. Second, our DAG seeks a more meaningful uτ for each utterance, rather than simply connecting each utterance with a fixed number of surrounding utterances."

(2020), we employ RoBERTa-Large (Liu et al., 2019), which has the same architecture as BERT-Large (Devlin et al., 2018), as our feature extractor. More specifically, for each utterance ui, we prepend a special token [CLS] to its tokens, making the input a form of {[CLS], wi1, wi2, ..., wini}.

(2)\nDirected acyclic graph models (DAGNN) work like a combination of GNN and RNN. They aggregate information for each node in temporal order, and allow all nodes to gather information from neighbors and update their states at the same layer:\nH li = f(Aggregate({H lj |j ∈ Ni}), H l−1i ). (3)\nThe strength of applying DAGNN to ERC is relatively apparent: By allowing information to propagate temporally at the same layer, DAGNN can get access to distant utterances and model the information flow throughout the whole conversation, which is hardly possible for GNN. Besides, DAGNN gathers information from several neighboring utterances, which sounds more appealing than RNN as the latter only receives information from the (i−1)-th utterance."

      "text" : "Our proposed DAG-ERC is primarily inspired by DAGNN (Thost and Chen, 2021), with novel improvements specially made for emotion recognition in conversation. At each layer l of DAG-ERC, due to the temporal information flow, the hidden state of utterances should be computed recurrently from the first utterance to the last one.\nFor each utterance ui, the attention weights between ui and its predecessors are calculated by using ui’s hidden state at the (l − 1)-th layer to attend to the predecessors’ hidden states at l-th layer:\nαlij = Softmaxj∈Ni(W l α[H l j‖H l−1i ]) (4)\nwhere W lα are trainable parameters and ‖ denotes the concatenation operation.\nThe information aggregation operation in DAGERC is different from that in DAGNN. Instead of merely gathering information according to the attention weights, inspired by R-GCN (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018), we apply a relation-aware feature\ntransformation to make full use of the relational type of edges:\nM li = ∑ j∈Ni αijW l rijH l j , (5)\nwhere W lrij ∈ {W l 0,W l 1} are trainable parameters for the relation-aware transformation. After the aggregated information M li is calculated, we make it interact with ui’s hidden state at the previous layer H l−1i to obtain the final hidden state of ui at the current layer. In DAGNN, the final hidden state is obtained by allowing M li to control information propagation of H l−1i to the l-th layer with a gated recurrent unit (GRU):\nH̃ li = GRU l H(H l−1 i ,M l i ), (6)\nwhereH l−1i ,M l i , and H̃ l i are the input, hidden state and output of the GRU, respectively. We refer to the process in Equation 6 as nodal information unit, because it focuses on the node information propagating from the past layer to the current layer. Nodal information unit may be suitable for the tasks that DAGNN is originally designed to solve. However, we find that only using nodal information unit is not enough for ERC, especially when the query utterance ui’s emotion should be derived from its context. The reason is that in DAGNN, the information of context M li is only used to control the propagation of ui’s hidden state, and under this circumstance, the information of context is not fully leveraged. Therefore, we design another GRU called contextual information unit to model the information flow of historical\ncontext through a single layer. In the contextual information unit, the roles ofH i−1i andM l i in GRU are reversed, i.e., H i−1i controls the propagation of M li :\nC li = GRU l M (M l i , H l−1 i ).

In addition to our proposed structure, we further define three kinds of DAG structure: (1) sequence, in which utterances are connected one by one; (2) DAG with single local information, in which each utterance only receives local information from its nearest neighbor, and the remote information remains the same as our DAG; (3) common DAG, in which each utterance is connected with κ previous utterances. Note that if there are only two speakers taking turns to speak in a dialog, then our DAG is equivalent to common DAG with κ = 2ω, making the comparison less meaningful. Therefore, we conduct the experiment on EmoryNLP, where there are usually multiple speakers in one dialog, and the\nspeakers speak in arbitrary order. The test performances are reported in Table 3, together with the average number of each utterance’s predecessors.\nSeveral instructive observations can be made from the experimental results. Firstly, the performance of DAG-ERC drops significantly when equipped with the sequence structure. Secondly, our proposed DAG structure has the highest performance among the DAG structures. Considering our DAG with ω = 2 and common DAG with κ = 6, with very close numbers of predecessors, our DAG still outperforms the common DAG by a certain margin. This indicates that the constraints based on speaker identity and positional relation are effective inductive biases, and the structure of our DAG is more suitable for the ERC task than rigidly connecting each utterance with a fixed number of predecessors. Finally, we find that increasing the value of ω may not contribute to the performance of our DAG, and ω = 1 tends to be enough."

We investigate whether the same phenomenon would happen when stacking many DAG-ERC layers.

Existing ERC models generally work poorly in emotional shift. As shown in Table 5, our DAGERC also fails to perform better on the samples with emotional shift than that without it, though the performance is still better than previous models. For example, the accuracy of DAG-ERC in the case of emotional shift is 57.98% on the IEMOCAP dataset, which is higher than 52.5% achieved by DialogueRNN (Majumder et al., 2019) and 55% achieved by DialogXL (Shen et al., 2020)."

Extensive experiments were conducted and the results show that the proposed DAG-ERC achieves comparable performance with the baselines. Moreover, by comprehensive evaluations and ablation study, we confirmed the superiority of our DAG-ERC and the impact of its modules. Several conclusions can be drawn from the empirical results. First, the DAG structures built from conversations do affect the performance of DAG-ERC, and with the constraints on speaker identity and positional relation, the proposed DAG structure outperforms its variants. Sec-\nond, the widely utilized graph relation type of whether two utterances have the same speaker is insufficient for multi-speaker conversations. Third, the directed acyclic graph network does not suffer over-smoothing as easily as GNNs when the number of layers increases. Finally, many of the errors misjudged by DAG-ERC can be accounted for by similar emotions, neutral samples and emotional shift. These reasons have been partly mentioned in previous works but have yet to be solved, which are worth further investigation in future work."

In this paper, we put forward a novel idea of encoding the utterances with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to better model the intrinsic structure within a conversation, and design a directed acyclic neural network, namely DAG-ERC1, to implement this idea. In an attempt to combine the strengths of conventional graph-based neural models and recurrence-based neural models, DAG-ERC provides a more intuitive way to model the information flow between long-distance conversation background and nearby context. Extensive experiments are conducted on four ERC benchmarks with state-of-the-art models employed as baselines for comparison. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of this new model and confirm the motivation of the directed acyclic graph architecture for ERC.",
