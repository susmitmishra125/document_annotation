      "text" : "Human-quality text has long been a holy grail for the output of natural language generation (NLG) systems, serving as an upper bound on their performance. Since we lack a good way of encoding many aspects of what constitutes human-quality output in an automated method, we often must rely on human evaluation for our models. Though evaluations with end-users in an applied setting are encouraged (Belz and Reiter, 2006), in practice, most human evaluations instead ask people to rate generated text’s intrinsic quality (van der Lee et al., 2019; Howcroft et al., 2020). Sometimes the generated text is explicitly compared to human-authored text (e.g., Liu et al., 2016; Zellers et al., 2021; Zhang\net al., 2020), but even when no human-authored text is evaluated, evaluators implicitly compare the generated text to their knowledge of language and norms within specific domains.\nEvaluators are often asked to assess a text holistically, e.g., based on its overall quality, naturalness, or humanlikeness (van der Lee et al., 2021; Howcroft et al., 2020), where the exact evaluation criteria is left to the discretion of the evaluator. Though other evaluations are broken down along specific dimensions of text quality (e.g., grammaticality, coherence, etc.), Novikova et al. (2017, 2018) and Callison-Burch et al. (2007) found that these dimensions are often correlated and may be conflated in some evaluation settings. This is con-\ncerning because, as NLG models improve, evaluators are asked to read longer passages of text conditioned on large amounts of context. In these cases, fluency-related aspects of quality (i.e., the ones that don’t require careful reading of the context and meaning of the passage) are the easiest to assess, particularly in small-batch evaluations with non-expert evaluators where speed is incentivized. This poses a challenge when collecting human evaluations for state-of-the-art language models, as errors are often content-based (e.g., factual inaccuracies or inconsistencies with the context) rather than fluency-based (Brown et al., 2020), so a superficial read may not be sufficient to catch model errors. For accurate assessments of generated text, we need human evaluations that are designed to encourage a sufficiently careful reading of the text to examine these subtler aspects of text quality.\nWe asked non-expert evaluators to assess the humanlikeness (operationalized as how believably human an evaluator finds a text) of text generated by current NLG models (GPT2 and GPT3) to test what current human evaluation practices can reveal about the models’ quality (§2). We found that evaluators were unable to distinguish between GPT3and human-authored text across story, news, and recipe domains. However, when we categorized the aspects of text the evaluators used to make their judgments, we found they primarily focused on the grammar, spelling, and style of the text. The evaluators’ responses also indicated that they underestimated the quality of text current models are capable of generating (as seen in Figure 1). To our knowledge, this paper is the first to evaluate human evaluations of GPT3-generated text across multiple domains.\nWe then looked at three different evaluator training methods—providing detailed instructions, annotated examples, and human-machine paired examples—to test whether we could improve evaluators’ accuracy (§3). While we found including examples in the task increased the set of texts evaluators thought could be machine-generated and increased their focus on textual content, no training method significantly increased evaluators’ performance consistently across domains.\nBased on our results (discussed in §4), we recommend moving away from small-batch evaluations with little training when collecting human evaluations of NLG models (§5). We also encourage practitioners to consider alternative evaluation frame-\nworks that capture the usefulness of generated text in downstream settings rather than its humanlikeness."

We only considered texts 100 words\n1beta.openai.com/ 2huggingface.co/gpt2-xl\nor longer, and after reaching 100 words, all texts were truncated at the end of the next sentence.3\nTo generate text, we used the “three-shot” setting described in Brown et al. (2020), conditioning the text on three additional samples of in-domain, human-authored text, which we refer to as the priming texts (all priming texts are in the supplementary materials and at ark.cs.washington.edu/ human_evals_ACL21). While this setting is not typically how GPT2 is used in practice, we held this approach constant to directly compare how model quality changes evaluators’ ability to distinguish between texts. For each domain, each generated text was conditioned on the same set of priming texts. The texts were delimited with an 〈EOS〉 token and generated using the default GPT3 generation settings (i.e., sampling with temperature = 0.7)."

We removed generated stories that directly copied a priming text (with > 80% overlap) and regenerated those texts (9 instances with GPT2, 2 with GPT3).\nThis is the most open-ended of the three domains, as the story’s content is virtually unrestricted, and the only creative domain.

We randomly chose 50 articles to use as our human-authored news articles and another 50 to use as prompts for our generation models. We conditioned each generated text on the headline and first sentence from the prompt articles, along with the three priming texts.\nBecause the title and the first sentence of a news article often summarize its contents, the generated content must adhere to the topics they introduce. By using local, recent news, we also limit the models’ ability to copy from their training data.

Following common best practice on AMT (Berinsky et al., 2012), evaluators had to have over a 95% acceptance rate, be in the United States, and have completed over 1,000 HITs (AMT tasks). We excluded evaluators’ work if their explanations were directly copied text from the task, did not match their responses, did not follow the instructions, or were short, vague, or otherwise uninterpretable.

While the accuracy of classifying GPT2- vs. human-authored text is significantly7 different from chance, evaluators’ accuracy distinguishing GPT3- and humanauthored text is not.8 This remains the case regardless of text domain; we failed to find any evidence that evaluators’ accuracy on any one domain for GPT3 differs from the overall GPT3 accuracy of ≈ 50%.9 The story texts saw the biggest drop in evaluator accuracy from GPT2 to GPT3 (62% to 48%, Cohen’s d = 0.57). The distribution of evaluators’ scores are shown in Appendix A.2.\nIn Table 1, we see other statistics worsen as well between GPT2 and GPT3: how well evaluators identified the machine-generated text (F1, precision, and recall), evaluators’ agreement (Krippendorff’s α, a measure of annotator agreement that\n6Unless otherwise noted, all analyses binned the responses into 2 categories (human and machine).\n7t388 = 6.58, p < 0.0001 8t388 = −0.09, p = 0.93 9ANOVA with F2,390 = 0.78, p = 0.46\ncorrects for the probability of random agreement), and the percent of guesses that the text was humanwritten (% human).

      "heading" : "2.5 Analysis",
      "text" : "Taken on its own, the evaluators’ difficulty identifying GPT3-generated text compared to GPT2 points to the improvement of new NLG models. However, it also points to concerns about extending current human evaluation methodologies to state-of-theart text generation. In particular, the evaluators’ explanations reveal underlying confusion and misconceptions about state-of-the-art NLG.\nTo better understand what untrained evaluators focused on in the text to make their decisions, the authors annotated 150 random responses from the evaluators who distinguished between human- and GPT3-generated text (see Appendix A.3 for annotation details). We divided the text annotation labels into three categories: form, content, and machine capabilities. Form qualities focus on the format, style, and tone of the text, while content focuses on the text’s meaning. We also coded for comments that explicitly referenced people’s perceptions of what types of language machines are capable (or incapable) of generating (machine capabilities).\nWe found nearly twice as many comments about the form of the text than the content (form: 47% of labels, content: 25%). Evaluators in our sample focused most on the spelling, grammar, or punctuation of the texts (45 out of 150 comments) and the style or tone of the text (24 out of 150 comments). However, these dimensions of text are unlikely to be helpful in identifying text generated by current models, considering that GPT3 has already been shown to generate fluent text and to adapt easily to new generation domains (Brown et al., 2020).\nWe also found that the reasons evaluators gave for their answers often contradicted each other. The formality of the text, spelling and grammar errors, and clarity were all cited to justify both human and machine judgments. This was also reflected in the low agreement scores between evaluators, with Krippendorff’s α ≈ 0 across domains.\nEvaluators’ expectations about what NLG mod-\nels are capable of ranged from thinking their text is already indistinguishable from human-authored text (“I have no idea if a human wrote anything these days. No idea at all.”) to doubting machines’ ability to use basic language (“Usually AI has terrible grammer [sic] and messes up.”). But overall we found most evaluators’ beliefs about generated language underestimated or misunderstood current NLG models, as seen in Appendix A.4.\n3 Can we train evaluators to better identify machine-generated text?\nGiven evaluators’ inability to distinguish GPT3and human-authored text and their inconsistent reasoning for their decisions, we investigated whether there were simple ways of improving evaluators’ ability to spot attributes of GPT3-generated text. Inspired by crowdsourcing research on guiding workers on writing or other subjective tasks (Kim et al., 2017; Mitra et al., 2015), we tested three lightweight evaluator-training methods to see if we could improve people’s ability to identify machinegenerated text while maintaining the short, lowcost nature of the evaluations."

Screenshots of the training interfaces\nare in Appendix A.6; the full set of training materials are in the supplementary materials and at ark.cs.washington.edu/human_evals_ACL21.\nOther than the training, the task setup was identical to the GPT3-based tasks in §2. We again ran the task on Amazon Mechanical Turk across three domains (stories, news, and recipes), using the same texts. As each individual participant was only permitted to complete one set of evaluations, the set of evaluators who received these trainings was completely disjoint from the set of evaluators from our first study. The participants were subject to the same restrictions described in §2.3 and excluded according the same criteria; we did not use the trainings to filter out evaluators.

We chose these dimensions based on previous work (Ippolito et al., 2020) and evaluators’ comments in a pilot study (see Appendix A.5).\nThe Instructions training was the simplest of our 3 evaluator training methods. It was general enough to be applied across the 3 domains but provided little information about the quality and domain of text the evaluator would be rating. It did not increase the cost of collecting evaluations (US$1.25 per HIT) because it does not require any extra work on the part of the evaluator, though this\nalso made it the easiest training to ignore. The instruction-based training is the most prescriptive of the training methods, as the researcher has to choose the dimensions they want the evaluators to focus on."

After an evaluator makes their guess, the correct answer and explanation are shown. Each domain had its own set of examples and explanations.\nBy showing examples, this training helps set the evaluators’ expectations about the quality of the human- and machine-generated text. We paid evaluators more for completing this task (US$1.75 per HIT) to compensate for the extra texts they needed to read. As with the instruction-based training, while pointing out specific text dimensions can help evaluators focus on important features, it may also restrict their search space."

This is perhaps due to the examples helping override the preconception that machines cannot generate “creative” text.\nAcross all 3 domains, the Examples and Comparison trainings produced the highest recall and F1 scores for evaluators’ judgments and decreased the percentage of texts they guessed were humanwritten, which indicate that evaluators were willing to consider a broader set of texts to be machinegenerated than the evaluators in §2.

      "heading" : "4 Discussion",
      "text" : "Overall, none of our three training methods significantly improved evaluators’ ability to detect machine-generated text reliably across text domains while still maintaining the small-batch nature of Amazon Mechanical Turk. This speaks to the improving quality of NLG models, but we also found that untrained evaluators mainly focused on the format of the text, deciding if it was human or machine-generated based on whether\nthe text was grammatically or stylistically correct. This, combined with the high percentage of human guesses, the low recall scores for the machine guesses, and the evaluators’ comments on their expectations of NLG models, indicates a systematic underestimation by the evaluators of the quality of machine-generated text. Evaluators who were trained with examples had higher expectations of machine-generated text and focused more on the text’s content; however, the training was not sufficient to significantly raise evaluators’ scores across all three domains.\nMany of the explanations given by evaluators included references to the text that reflected human attributes or intent that they suspected machines could not generate (e.g., “personal description a machine wouldn’t understand, [like a pirate] wanting to be home with his wife and son” from Figure 1 and the examples in Appendix A.4). However, current NLG models are capable of generating\ntext with at least superficial reference to human attributes or intent, as seen in the generated story in Figure 1. This assumption that machines can’t generate text with these aspects of humanlikeness led many evaluators astray, and we suspect it is one cause of the low accuracy we found.\nCrowdsourcing studies dealing only with humanauthored texts often include extensive training, quality checks, or coordination (Kittur and Kraut, 2008; Kim et al., 2017; Bernstein et al., 2010). NLG evaluations usually forego such structures, based, we suspect, on the assumption that evaluating machine-generated text requires only fluency in the language the text is generated in. Our results suggest otherwise. Evaluators often mistook machine-generated text as human, citing superficial textual features that machine generation has surpassed (Brown et al., 2020). One potential remedy for this is to focus evaluator training on debunking this misconception. We did see evidence that the increase in accuracy we saw with our Examples training was associated with fewer explanations mistakenly referencing machine capabilities, even though the training did not specifically focus on this."

      "heading" : "5 Recommendations",
      "text" : "Based on our findings, if NLG researchers must run human evaluations as small-batch evaluations\non Amazon Mechanical Turk or similar platforms, we recommend they train evaluators with examples. This will help calibrate the evaluators’ expectations of generated text and indicate the careful reading they may need to do to properly assess the text’s quality. Our experiments also indicate the importance of confirming with evaluators why they have made the decisions they have, as the criteria they might implicitly be evaluating may be mismatched with researchers’ intended criteria. However, other evaluation setups may be more successful on Amazon Mechanical Turk, such as long-term evaluations with qualified evaluators who have gone through an extended training (like those in Kittur and Kraut, 2008; Zellers et al., 2019a) or thirdparty evaluator quality tools (e.g., Positly, used by Brown et al., 2020).\nHowever, given the increasing length of text NLG models can handle and the careful reading needed to detect many errors in generated text, we encourage NLG researchers to move away from standalone, intrinsic human evaluation tasks. We found that, by default, our evaluators in this evaluation setting were most likely to focus on surfacelevel, fluency-related aspects of quality. We join past work (Belz and Reiter, 2006; van der Lee et al., 2021) in recommending a move towards evaluation settings where evaluators are better motivated to carefully consider the content and usefulness of generated text. For example, TuringAdvice (Zellers et al., 2021) asks evaluators to rate NLG models by their ability to generate helpful advice, and RoFT (Dugan et al., 2020) engages evaluators through a guessing game to determine the boundary between human- and machine-generated text. Other evaluation methods ask the evaluators to directly interact with the generated text; for example, Choose Your Own Adventure (Clark and Smith, 2021) and Storium (Akoury et al., 2020) evaluate story generation models by having people write stories with the help of generated text.11 We see that GPT3 can successfully mimic human-authored text across several domains, renewing the importance of evaluations that push beyond surface-level notions of quality and consider whether a text is helpful in a down-\n11Note that we initially tried a fourth training condition along these lines, where we asked evaluators to directly interact with the generated text by rewriting it be more humanlike. We found we were unable to successfully recruit evaluators to complete this task. The rate of retention was less than 30%, and the rejection rate was over 50%. We found AMT was not a good platform for this type of task, at least not for the format and the price point we explored in this work.\nstream setting or has attributes that people would want from machine-generated text.\nFinally, given the mixed effect we found different trainings can have on evaluators’ performance and the lack of human evaluation details typically presented in NLG papers (van der Lee et al., 2019; Howcroft et al., 2020), we encourage NLG researchers to include details of any instructions and training they gave evaluators in their publications. This, along with efforts to standardize human evaluation design (Belz et al., 2020; Howcroft et al., 2020) and deployment (Khashabi et al., 2021; Gehrmann et al., 2021), will support future development of evaluator training procedures and the comparison of human evaluation results in future NLG evaluation work."

Additionally, crowdsourcing literature has work on effectively using platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (e.g., Daniel et al., 2018; Oppenheimer et al., 2009; Weld et al., 2014; Mitra et al., 2015). In this work, we focus on the role evaluator training can play for producing better accuracy at distinguishing human- and machinegenerated text, though other quality control methods are worth exploring.\nPrevious work has asked evaluators to distinguish between human- and machine-authored text; for example, Ippolito et al. (2020) found that trained evaluators were able to detect open-ended GPT2-L-generated text 71.4% of the time and Brown et al. (2020) found evaluators could guess GPT3-davinci-generated news articles’ source with 52% accuracy, though these results are not directly comparable to ours due to differences in the evaluation setup, data, and participants.\nFinally, our findings that untrained evaluators are not well equipped to detect machine-generated text point to the importance of researching the safe de-\nployment of NLG systems. Gehrmann et al. (2019) proposed visualization techniques to help readers detect generated text, and work like Zellers et al. (2019b), Ippolito et al. (2020), and Uchendu et al. (2020) investigated large language models’ ability to detect generated text."

The human-authored news articles and prompts came from the following states and websites:\n• HI: www.westhawaiitoday.com • CT: www.greenwichtime.com/ • WA: www.vashonbeachcomber.com/ • SD: www.argusleader.com/ • CA: www.redding.com/ • MA: www.lowellsun.com/ • NE: starherald.com/ • VA: dailyprogress.com/ • WV: www.theintermountain.com/ • NM: www.lcsun-news.com/ • LA: www.nola.com/ • IA: qctimes.com/ • NY: www.pressconnects.com/ • IN: www.pal-item.com/ • NJ: www.northjersey.com/\nA.2 Score Frequencies The frequency of the scores (out of 5) received by evaluators is shown in Figures 3 (for GPT2 experiments) and 4 (for GPT3 experiments).\nA.3 Annotation Details The authors annotated 300 comments (150 from the No Training experiment and 150 from the Examples experiment). For each experiment, we randomly chose 50 authors from each setting and randomly added 1 of their responses to the annotation set. Each comment was annotated by 2 of the authors. The annotation labels are shown in Table 4. To create the set of annotation labels, the authors created a candidate list of labels, annotated a subset of the data collected in the pilot study (Appendix A.5) together, then another subset separately, and finally refined the labels based on feedback from that process. Because evaluators’ responses often contained more than one reason for their choice, comments could receive more than one label.\nA.4 Evaluators’ Expectations of Generated Text\nBecause we asked evaluators whether they thought the text was human- or machine-authored, they\noften justified their choices by explaining what types of human language they believed machines could (or could not) generate. We took note of these comments and annotated for them in our data annotation process (Appendix A.3) because they demonstrate the expectations evaluators have for the quality of machine-generated text. Some example comments shown in Table 5.\nA.5 Pilot Study Before running the experiments described in the paper, we ran a smaller-scale version with both Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 22) and “expert” evaluators (NLP graduate students; n = 11). We asked the evaluators to distinguish between stories authored by humans, GPT2, and GPT3 and to explain their reasoning. When we coded and analyzed their responses, we found that the most accurate evaluators focused on textual aspects like repetition and were less likely to mention aspects like style. The AMT evaluators mentioned grammar and spelling far more frequently than the expert evaluators, who were more likely to mention the repetition, factuality, and commonsense of the passage.\nA.6 Training and Instructions Figure 5 shows the basic instructions that were shown to all evaluators, in both §2 and §3, regardless of training or domain. All training information occurred after receiving the basic instructions.\nA.6.1 Instruction Training The training shown to evaluators in the Instruction training condition is shown in Figure 6.\nA.6.2 Example Training A screenshot of the Examples and Comparison training is in Figure 7. The full set of examples and annotations used in the Examples and Comparison trainings can be found in the supplementary materials and at ark.cs.washington.edu/ human_evals_ACL21."

We run a study assessing nonexperts’ ability to distinguish between humanand machine-authored text (GPT2 and GPT3) in three domains (stories, news articles, and recipes). We find that, without training, evaluators distinguished between GPT3and humanauthored text at random chance level. We explore three approaches for quickly training evaluators to better identify GPT3-authored text (detailed instructions, annotated examples, and paired examples) and find that while evaluators’ accuracy improved up to 55%, it did not significantly improve across the three domains. Given the inconsistent results across text domains and the often contradictory reasons evaluators gave for their judgments, we examine the role untrained human evaluations play in NLG evaluation and provide recommendations to NLG researchers for improving human evaluations of text generated from state-of-the-art models.",
