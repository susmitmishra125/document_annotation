Prior work has sought to automatically identify grooming chats, but only after an incidence has already happened in the context of legal prosecution. In this work, we instead investigate this problem from the point of view of prevention. We define and study the task of early sexual predator detection (eSPD) in chats, where the goal is to analyze a running chat from its beginning and predict grooming attempts as early and as accurately as possible. We survey existing datasets and their limitations regarding eSPD, and create a new dataset called PANC for more realistic evaluations. We present strong baselines built on BERT that also reach state-of-the-art results for conventional SPD. Finally, we consider coping with limited computational resources, as real-life applications require eSPD on mobile devices."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Online grooming denotes the process where a socalled sexual predator establishes an emotional connection with a minor online to systematically solicit and exploit them for sexual purposes (Wachs et al., 2012). Online grooming is a major concern of public safety that, sadly, is rapidly growing. For instance, in England and Wales in the year to mid-2020, police recorded 5,083 offenses of Sexual Communication with a Child [1], an average of 14 offenses per day. In Germany, there were 2,632 recorded cases in 2020 where a child was sexually abused through internet communication technologies [2], an increase of 50% to the previous year. As such crimes often go unreported or undetected, police-recorded incidents certainly do\nnot fully reflect the real scale of the issue (Bowles and Keller, 2019; McGuire and Dowling, 2013).\nThe problem of detecting whether or not a child is being groomed by a predator is called sexual predator detection (SPD). Most previous approaches to SPD have cast this as the problem of identifying predatory authors in a corpus of segments of chats (Villatoro-Tello et al., 2012; Cardei and Rebedea, 2017). Other approaches interpreted it as a binary classification problem over segments of a chat (Ebrahimi et al., 2016), or the entire chat (Bours and Kulsrud, 2019). Approaches were evaluated mostly using data from the PAN shared task on sexual predator detection (Inches and Crestani, 2012). However, most prior work has\nviewed SPD from the point of view of forensics: they focused on identifying completed grooming chats in preparation for legal prosecution.\nWe believe that it is also important to study approaches that may prevent online grooming – as early as possible, i.e., during an ongoing chat. Ideally, the grooming process should be disrupted before it succeeds to protect children from harm. This task is non-trivial as the content of grooming chats changes over time: chats often start with the exchange of personal information and building of trust, a phase in which they are difficult to detect. In a second stage, predators further develop trust with their victims in a cycle of entrapment. They try to desensitize their victims to sexual topics, isolate them from others, and arrange meetings (Olson et al., 2007, p. 236). Even in this second stage, it is difficult to distinguish between grooming and consensual conversations between minors or adults. For this, a model needs to be able to detect discriminative features like a user talking about age difference, checking on the victim’s relationship with their parents, isolating them from their support network, reframing sexual actions as appropriate and more (see Olson et al. (2007), pp. 234ff).\nAn example of arranging a meeting is shown in Figure 1. Here, an alert is triggered only late in the grooming process, when an in-person meeting is already explicitly being discussed. Ideally, such chats should be detected far sooner. However, the real-world consequences of a triggered eSPD alert can be considerable and may involve police actions. This means that false alerts should be avoided as much as possible. At the same time, false negatives must be avoided by all means as these could lead to a sexual assault. It is therefore as important as ethically difficult to find the best balance between the earliness of an alert and the certainty that an alert is justified."

We cast eSPD as an early risk detection problem in which chats are analyzed from the start and message by message, with the goal of raising warnings for chats early and accurately. Specifically, we make the following contributions:\n• We introduce the problem of eSPD and for-\nmally define it.\n• We survey available datasets, analyze their\nlimitations, and build a new combined dataset called PANC as a best-effort for evaluating eSPD. • We propose a task setup to evaluate eSPD,\nfocusing on the trade-off between earliness and accuracy. • We present strong baselines for eSPD using a\ntwo-tier approach. Our method (1) analyzes sliding windows of messages from an ongoing chat using BERT and (2) continuously classifies the sequence of the window classifications. We evaluate three different BERT language models, two of which work on mobile. • We compare our models to previous research\nin conventional (i.e. “non-early”) SPD settings and find that two of them outperform the current state of the art. • We provide an extensive discussion of the lim-\nitations of our models and the available data.\nWe see our work as an important step to encourage more research into eSPD. To this end, we make our experimental setup, our baseline models, scripts for corpus processing, and the visualization tool for inspecting analyzed chats (used to generate Figure 1) publicly available1. We emphasize that we do not consider our models to be ready for use in real scenarios, which we discuss in depth in our Ethics Statement (see below)."

      "text" : "The PAN Lab at the 2012 CLEF conference introduced a shared task on sexual predator identification [7]. The organizers created a large dataset which we call PAN12 using data from PJ. As nongrooming chats, they sampled from logs of IRC channels and of the chatting site Omegle [11]. These chats also include cybersex between consenting adults among non-predatory conversations, which makes distinguishing grooming chats especially difficult. They divided chats into segments whenever a conversation was interrupted for more than 25 minutes and filtered all segments with more than 150 messages. This results in a total of 222k segments, of which 2.58% are grooming chats, through which the organizers try to mimic the distribution of grooming in actual online conversations. They are partitioned into train and test splits of a 30:70 ratio.\nPAN12 has several limitations. All grooming chats stem from decoy operations and are not with actual victims, and the non-grooming chats are not with decoys. real. Most problematic for eSPD is the separation into relatively short, unordered segments, thus completely blurring the true timeline of a chat. This makes the data unsuitable for eSPD since we aim to detect predators as early as possible in potentially long-running chats."

They created a new dataset (VTPAN) by removing from PAN12 segments that have only one participant, less than 6 interactions per user, or long sequences of special characters (often depicting ASCII art). Many short segments which stem from predatory chats actually contain no predatory language, so a benefit of VTPAN is that many of these segments are filtered. The dataset is only 10% of the size of PAN12, and is also used in recent work on SPD (Escalante et al., 2016, 2017; Pastor ĹopezMonroy et al., 2018).

The commonly used datasets PAN12 and VTPAN only contain short, disjointed, and unordered chat segments. For eSPD, however, one needs to detect grooming in a continuous message stream, which is ordered and theoretically unbounded in length. Classifying segments only, we have no information about how early in the complete chat grooming is detected. Moreover, evaluating earliness within single segments would not be interesting as it is not interpretable and because they are so short. While CC2 does have full chat logs, it does not contain any negative samples. Our analysis thus motivates the assembly of the new PANC dataset as explained in the next section."

      "heading" : "3.1 Task definition",
      "text" : "We interpret eSPD as an early risk detection problem (Losada et al., 2020). This means that we need to consider the earliness and the accuracy of warnings, continuously analyzing a chat after each new message. Formally: Definition 1 (Message). A message is a string with a time and an author. Definition 2 (Chat). A chat C = (m1,m2, . . . ) is a sequence of messages mi where the time of messages is monotonically increasing. A finite chat is of the form Ĉ = (m1, . . . ,mn), where we say Ĉ has a length of n. We call grooming chats positive and other chats negative. This is the class of a chat.\nThe length of real chats is potentially unbounded and keeps increasing, so regarding real chats as infinite is handy. We analyze chats after each new message, thus considering only finite prefixes for classification. Definition 3 (Prefix). Let C = (m1, . . . ,ml, . . . ) be a chat. We call C(l) := (m1, . . . ,ml) the prefix of C with length l.\nFinally, we define eSPD as follows. Definition 4 (eSPD). Let XTest be a dataset of finite chats. For C = (m1, . . . ,mn) ∈ XTest and l = 1, . . . , n increasing over time, an eSPD system decides for each l whether a warning for C should be raised or not by classifying C(l). It stops as soon as a warning is raised, classifying C as grooming. If no warning is raised for all l = 1, . . . , n, it classifies C as non-grooming. Finally, eSPD is the problem of classifying all C ∈ XTest as early and accurately as possible.\nNote that this definition deliberately states that an eSPD system never classifies a chat as nongrooming as long as there are messages left (or the chat did not end, in a real-life setting), as it cannot know the future after the current prefix C(l)."

      "heading" : "3.2.2 Earliness of warnings",
      "text" : "We call the number of messages that have been exchanged before a warning is raised the warning latency. We use latency-weighted F1 (Sadeque et al., 2018) as a measure that accounts for both warning accuracy and warning latency. To calculate it, we first define a penalty for each warning latency l ≥ 1 given by\npenalty(l) := −1 + 2\n1 + exp(−p · (l − 1))\nwhere p determines how quickly the penalty should increase as latency increases. A warning after the first message receives 0 penalty and for increasing warning latency, the penalty approaches 1.\nNow assume an eSPD system to produce a list latencies of warning latencies for all chats C ∈ XTest where (1) C is positive, and (2) the system raises a warning for C. We define the overall speed of correct warnings as\nspeed := 1−median{penalty(l) | l ∈ latencies}.\nThis metric is more interpretable than just using the mean or median warning latency, as it depends on the problem and the dataset at hand how good a median warning latency actually is. Finally, the latency-weighted F1 is given by Flatency := F1 · speed. We generally consider an eSPD system A better than an eSPD system B when it reaches, for a given dataset, a higher Flatency; comparisons focusing more on speed or more on accuracy or searching for pareto-optimal solutions are also possible. Note that we, following Losada et al. (2019), compute the speed of warnings only for grooming chats classified as such. All other cases (false positives, false negatives, true negatives) are accounted for through the F1 value."

      "heading" : "3.3 The PANC dataset",
      "text" : "Evaluating an eSPD system needs a corpus of chats, where each entire chat is annotated as grooming or not. Note that we do not require this annotation\non the message level, as what constitutes the first grooming message in a chat is highly subjective. Furthermore, eSPD based on supervised learning requires an annotated training corpus. Existing datasets cannot be directly used for this purpose, because they either consist only of unordered segments (VTPAN, PAN12), which hinders measuring speed, or only contain positive chats (CC2), which makes measuring F1 impossible. Furthermore, the existing corpora all use PJ grooming chats and partly overlap.\nTo address these issues, we assembled PANC, an evaluation dataset for eSPD, by carefully combining selected parts from PAN12 and from CC2. The process is illustrated in Figure 2: The final corpus consists of (1) all positive full length chats from CC2 and (2) the negative segments of PAN12. We randomly split the corpus on this level at proportions 60:40 into train/test splits. Through (1), we can evaluate earliness. We cannot measure accuracy as defined above due to the lack of full-length negative chats. Instead, in the experiments, we will compute accuracy based on segments as an estimate of (2), for which we split the full-length grooming chats into segments. We filter all segments shorter than 6 messages, similar to VTPAN, and those longer than 150 messages (some of the latter were actually not filtered in PAN12, contrary to its original specification). Finally, we removed segments that are not between exactly two authors to make them comparable to CC2 chats. Statistics on the resulting corpus are given in Table 1.\nDiscussion. We consider PANC to be the first corpus suitable for realistic eSPD evaluations. Yet it still has limitations: First, the negative chats are not full-length chats but only segments. While this does not impact our earliness evaluation, it prevents the computation of true eSPD accuracy. Our proposed workaround is to replace chat accuracy with segment accuracy, although we do not know how well the latter approximates the former as we therein classify short segments which can stem from anywhere in a chat. An alternative would be to use a difference source for the negative chats;\nhowever, we decided on those from PAN12 as they also include “hard negative” cases (i.e. sexual conversations between consenting adults), which we believe gives more realism to our evaluation. Another limitation is that PANC only contains chats between exactly two authors, so our systems are not applicable in group chats. However, grooming is very rare in group chats as predators depend on their actions staying unnoticed."

We use a window size of 50 and a skepticism of 5; an evaluation of the impact of the skepticism parameter can also be found below. We fine-tune each of our BERT models on PANC and VTPAN. As the results of fine-tuning BERT models often vary heavily based on the random seed used (Dodge et al., 2020), we repeat this process three times. In the evaluation, we always report the mean of the resulting measures together with standard deviation.

To compute the Flatency of warnings, we measured their F1 score for segments, while speed is based on full positive chats (see Section 3). Evaluating earliness in isolation. Figure 3 shows violin plots of the distribution of warning latencies for the three systems for all predator chats from PANCTest, based on the means over three runs. The systems SBERT-large and SMobileBERT have similar performance while SBERT-base outperforms both. Its median warning latency is roughly 30 messages lower compared to the other systems. Moreover, SBERT-base exhibits much less variance in warning\nlatency than the other two models. An explanation of the somewhat surprising scores of SBERT-large is that one of the three runs of this model led to significantly worse results than the other runs. As a consequence, the standard deviation of this model is also much higher than for the other two models.\nInterpreting and penalizing warning latency. To calculate Flatency, we need to set the parameter p which controls the penalty that is assigned to a given warning latency. However, when inspecting the full-length predator chats, we noticed that the number of messages before a chat gets suspicious varies heavily, and there is no “typical” value for this, which makes setting p difficult. We believe that it would be better to not set p globally but on a chat by chat basis, which could be done in future work. Conventionally (Sadeque et al., 2018; Losada et al., 2019), p is set such that the penalty is 0.5 at the median length of chats. But for our full-length predator chats, this would be 1,055 messages which we think is way too late to raise a warning. Ultimately, we decided to set p with help from the message labels from CC2. We set p such that the penalty is 0.5 when about 20 grooming messages are exchanged. In median for the labeled CC2 chats, this is 90 messages, so we set p = ln(3)/(90 − 1) ≈ 0.0123. However, the standard deviation for this is about 200 messages.\nBest baseline approach. As Table 2 shows, overall results differ whether one considers only F1 or Flatency: Considering F1, SBERT-large and SBERT-base have similar performance and both outperform SMobileBERT. However, when considering speed, BERTbase significantly outperforms the other models. One of the BERTlarge runs only scored a speed of 0.55 , which is why the mean speed is unexpectedly low and the standard deviation is high. In Flatency, SBERT-base outperforms SBERT-large by 0.14 which again outperforms SMobileBERT by 0.09 . Impact of skepticism. The skepticism hyperparameter s controls the propensity of the Tier-2 classifier to raise warnings and can thus be seen as the central knob to tune the earliness/accuracy trade-off for our approach. We would expect that being more skeptical leads to a lower recall, higher precision, and higher latency of warnings. To confirm this, we evaluate each of our eSPD systems on PANC for each skepticism s = 1, . . . , 10 and note precision, recall, and speed of warnings depending on skepticism. Here, the speed of warnings is calculated as explained in Section 3.2.2.\nIn Figure 4, we plot the concrete accuracy and speed metrics of our eSPD systems, depending on the skepticism of the Tier-2 classifiers. For all of our systems, we indeed find that as skepticism increases, precision increases as well, while recall and speed are decreasing. Moreover, the Flatency of our detectors does not significantly change as long as s is in a medium range of {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, except for SBERT-large, but here the standard deviation of Flatency is so high that no clear correlation exists."

This allows us to compare against the state-of-the-art approaches by Escalante et al. (2017) and Pastor Ĺopez-Monroy et al. (2018).\nEvaluation setup. For this comparison, we replicate their evaluation setting in which they classify segments on VTPAN by considering increasing fractions of each segment as measured by the number of characters. They evaluate their SPD accuracy after 10%, 20%, . . . , 100% of all characters of a segment where only whole words are included. As classification is not message-by-message, we only use our Tier-1 classifiers in this setting. Note that evaluating accuracy as a function of fraction\nof a segment also may be interpreted as earliness, though in a very different sense than proposed for eSPD in this paper, because segments are much shorter than chats and may be from anywhere within a chat.\nNew state of the art on SPD. Figure 5 summarizes the results of this comparison. Notably, even the MobileBERT model is competitive with previous works in spite of being much less resource hungry. Both other models outperform previous works for all settings. The difference in performance is especially large for small segment prefixes and de-\ncreases with increasing availability of information. For 10% of information, BERTlarge outperforms the SOTA by as much as 8% in F1. A complete list of the F1 values is given in Appendix B. Discussion. We believe that improvements primarily stem from our usage of BERT, which previously had not been applied to SPD. The implementations of previous approaches are not openly available, so we cannot directly compare example inputs. But prior work uses document representations where words are considered irrespective of their context. Thus, we believe that these approaches are mostly able to detect grooming attempts that use specific words, for instance those with a sexual connotation. A BERT-style transformer model on the other hand may be able to better distinguish whether the overall context in which words are used is a grooming context and identify attempts that use more indirect language such as innuendo."

Furthermore, youth language changes very fast over the years; as our corpus is from 2012, it is questionable how well it would represent current chats. For instance, it does not contain any emojis. Another issue is the lack of deep relationships in our non-grooming chats. Among those, the only chats with personal or intimate conversations are from Omegle.

      "text" : "Online grooming is a real and pressing problem faced by any chat system open to children. Accordingly, social media sites and games often use automated grooming detection systems (Bowles and\nKeller, 2019). For example, YouTube applies NLP to detect predatory messages in video comments and livestream chats followed by human verification (IICSA and Canegallo, 2019, p. 63, ll. 10–25). Microsoft uses a similar approach for XBOX Live and Skype chat [6] and also licenses their software to other service providers free of charge (Patel, 2020). Their obvious advantage over academic research is the access to much larger datasets. However, these solutions are server-based and cannot be applied for end-to-end encrypted chats. Many parents also resort to using parental control apps, some of which send children’s chats to external servers for analysis, which is a privacy concern. Because of these reasons, there is a need for eSPD systems even on mobile devices.\nIn academia, eSPD so far has seen comparably little research despite its high societal importance, probably due to the difficulties of obtaining appropriate datasets. Villatoro-Tello et al. (2012) was the winning team of the first problem of the PAN12 competition, which was the identification of the predatory authors of the PAN12 segments. They approached the problem by first predicting segments as grooming or not and then distinguishing victim from predator. This two-step method was refined by Cardei and Rebedea (2017) who additionally used behavioral features, such as the number of questions asked, achieving an F0.5 of 0.934 for segment classification on a subset of PAN12Test. Bours and Kulsrud (2019) studied the same problem and included an analysis of early segment classification, i.e., an attempt to find predators early within a segment. They explored their method also by applying it to 10 full-length PJ chats, which could be seen as the first instance of eSPD we are aware of.\nEarly text classification. To our knowledge, Escalante et al. (2016) was the first work to approach SPD from an early text classification perspective, but restricted their analysis to the segment level. Their results were improved in Escalante et al. (2017) using profile-based representations, where documents are represented as normalized sums of vector representations of words. The best results so far for early segment classification were achieved by Pastor Ĺopez-Monroy et al. (2018) using a Multi-Resolution Representation (MulR) for documents to cope equally well with longer and shorter segments. We compared to the results of the latter two works in Section 5.2 and found that our approach outperforms both. Note that we are\nnot aware of any previous work employing transformers for SPD. Early time series classification. An interesting perspective on our Tier 2 is that it actually solves an early time series classification (eTSC) problem, for which there exist several mature approaches, e.g. TEASER (Schäfer and Leser, 2020) or ECTS (Xing et al., 2012). However, there exists a key difference that prevents us from using such methods directly: An eSPD System never classifies a chat as nongrooming as long as there are still messages left (or expected), while an eTSC system at some stage might decide that it is safe to stop controlling the chat (Loyola et al., 2018). This opens the door to malicious attacks by using long and harmless openings in grooming attempts. We nevertheless believe exploring ways to adapt eTSC to eSPD to be an interesting avenue for future research."

      "text" : "We defined the problem of early sexual predator detection (eSPD) in online chats and proposed an evaluation setup for this task. To this end, we assembled the PANC dataset, which, albeit having clear limitations, in our mind is the currently best effort possible with the data available. We also showed that a baseline built on current BERT-based language models achieves strong results on this dataset, and beats previous methods in related settings. Notably, results are only modestly impacted for models that can run on mobile devices. We discussed open issues in our data and evaluation setup that must be studied carefully in future work before eSPD systems could go live (and expand on this discussion in Appendix D). We hope that making our task setup accessible to the research community will encourage more research into the highly important topic of early sexual predator detection."

We thank the Institute of Sexology and Sexual Medicine at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin for introducing us to the problem of online grooming and the need for automatic solutions, and fruitful discussions. Finally, we thank the TensorFlow Lite Support Team and specifically Chen Cen for creating a workaround that enables our BERT models to work on mobile.\nEthics Statement\nEarly sexual predator detection is a highly sensitive topic which calls for a proper discussion of potential implications of such research, the datasets being used, and the readiness of eSPD models. There are potentially high stakes for any subject whose chats are analyzed by eSPD systems. Any application of eSPD in running chat systems would incur interaction with vulnerable populations (minors) which must be firmly protected. False-negative, as well as false-positive predictions, may have severe implications for the falsely alleged chat partner or the erroneously unprotected child, respectively. Online grooming is forbidden by law in many countries, as are the establishment of sexual relationships of any kind to children. In many countries, including Germany, already obtaining logs of chat content with sexual content involving children is forbidden, which makes acquisition or usage of real data impossible outside criminal investigations. At the same time, online grooming does happen now, and in many instances, making research into ways to prevent or at least diminish it important.\nDatasets. For this study, we did not create any new data or perform any experiments with human beings. According to European regulations, such research does not require an ethics vote from an institutional review board. Instead, we performed specific filtering and combination of data from the two datasets PAN12 and ChatCoder2 (CC2), which are available on request to their authors, and have been extensively used in the literature.\nThe creators of PAN12 anonymized the data by removing usernames and email addresses to avoid the identification of users. This makes PAN12 compatible with European regulations that permit the exchange of carefully anonymized data. The CC2 chats stem from PJ and are with offenders who were prosecuted in court and adult decoys posing as children. Thus, they contain no conversations with minors or victims, which makes CC2 compatible with the above-mentioned regulations against possession and usage of any real chat logs involving sexual content with children.\nReadiness of eSPD models. Real-world applications already use automatic systems to support detection of grooming in chats (Patel, 2020; Bowles and Keller, 2019), yet no details about their measured performance and internal functioning are known to us. However, we do not consider the models and methods presented in this paper as ready for\nproduction systems. We already discussed some of their technical limitations in Section 6. On top of these, we believe that any eSPD system must be carefully adapted to any concrete chat system and continuously retrained and monitored to be able to pick up specific styles of communication and how they change over time. Additionally, any system applying eSPD must take an ethically highly difficult decision regarding the trade-off between the two immanent desiderata for eSPD systems: the earliness of warnings and their accuracy. Perfectly achieving both, i.e., performing only correct classifications after the very first message, is impossible. In this research paper, we studied the impact of our skepticism factor which controls this trade-off. The concrete setting of this (or a similar) parameter in a real application must depend on an independent and careful assessment of consequences of false positive and false negative alarms. This decision must take the respective circumstances into account and requires an application-specific ethical assessment of its own, including options of monitoring by human professionals as discussed in Appendix D."

Such chats are most likely very rare among the negative PAN12 segments, which we use for PANC. In Figure 6, we can see two excerpts from positive chats for which SBERT-large raises warnings. In our opinion, out of context, the excerpts could just as well occur in a regular chat between lovers, so they should not be classified as grooming by themselves. This is an example of a feature that is discriminative in our datasets but not in reality."

      "heading" : "D Further discussion: Scenarios for applications of eSPD systems",
      "text" : "We see two main operational modes in which eSPD systems as presented in this paper could be deployed. Chats may either be analyzed centrally, i.e. at the messenger’s server, or decentrally, i.e. at the chat clients. These modes lead to very different situations regarding the earliness/accuracy trade-off. Server-side systems. In most systems, chats are stored on a server of the chat provider. This enables a hybrid setup that combines automatic predictions with manual verification by experts: eSPD systems would be used to flag suspicious chats at scale which are then referred to trained professionals. Only if professionals agree, proper actions would be taken, like stopping the chat, notifying certain persons, referring to appropriate institutions like\nthe CyberTipline [14], or informing the police. Such a hybrid approach reduces the danger of false alarms. For example, YouTube handles live-stream chats with such an approach, as stated in IICSA and Canegallo (2019, p. 63, ll. 10–25).\nHowever, even in a hybrid setup, we encounter ethical questions regarding the trade-off between earliness and accuracy of warnings. If the eSPD system prioritizes earliness and thus raises many warnings, it might result in a flood of warnings that can quickly overwhelm moderators. Moreover, mass moderation of user chats could raise privacy concerns. On the other hand, if the system prioritizes accuracy, this may lead to a failure to prevent sexual assaults of minors. Finding the specific balance for a given application requires careful ethical considerations whose reasoning should be made transparent to the users, and in case of minors especially to the parents. To use a messaging application, users should have to give informed consent to the system-specific regulations, the modes of control and moderation, and the potential risks of the implemented strategies.\nClient-side systems. As many messaging (and chatting) systems are moving toward end-to-end encryption [15], the previously described mode of centralized application of eSPD becomes increasingly infeasible, as neither moderators nor software are able to decrypt the chats once they left the device of the chatting persons. In this case, eSPD systems can only be deployed on the chat client, which is in most cases a smartphone. They could be installed separately from the client, or be already integrated into the client. The latter could result in warnings being created both at the side of the child and at the side of the potential predator; both cases must be analyzed carefully. Note that during installation, the software is not able to control whether it is being installed on the smartphone of an adult or of a minor.\nOn the child side, systems could be configured to (1) send alerts to the parents of the minor, (2) directly alerting the minor, or (3) both. Option (2) is beneficial for the privacy of the minor, but places a higher responsibility on them to adequately deal with warnings. A grooming alert would have to be communicated very carefully to not be traumatizing. In all of the above cases, children could also mistakenly assume that the eSPD system is a bullet-proof “safety net” that allows them to be less careful when chatting online. A missing alert\ncould be interpreted as that a chat is safe, no matter what is being communicated, which would actually reduce the safety of the child. Options (1) and (3) create greater safety for the minor, but at the risk that parents are sometimes falsely warned in situations where no online grooming takes place, which could quickly result in psychologically delicate situations. Parents are not trained professionals, as moderators are, which increases the chances of misunderstanding warnings. One can imagine that uninformed and very cautious parents call the police in any case of a warning without any further checks, which in case of false alarms would lead to wrong allegations, psychological stress, and societal stigma on part of the accused.\nWe should further consider that a predator could use an eSPD system and monitor its assessment of the ongoing chat to anticipate warnings. This could signal the predator to change wording and language to circumvent detection. One could even imagine systems where the predator can check if sending a specific message would trigger a warning (by running a second, parallel yet faked chat). While messages by the victim could also trigger warnings, the predator could still use the method to make detection much less likely, and possibly to learn how to use language to elude the system. In any case, to avoid predators finding ways to circumvent detection, the specific eSPD system used by the application should not be made available separately. Users should also not be able to see the current “risk level” of a chat or to control the sensitivity of warnings.\nOverall, client-side systems thus face challenges in how and to whom to raise warnings. Warnings should on the one hand be disruptive enough to be taken seriously by the user while at the other hand clearly communicating that a warning is only an estimation and therefore does not establish guilt. Users might also be given the option to disable alerts for certain contacts whom they trust to reduce the number of false alerts. For systems that raise warnings to a minor’s parents, it would be important to include clear messaging to the parent that eSPD systems are not perfect and may both raise false warnings as well as miss actual grooming attempts. The parent should be clearly advised that an eSPD system offers only partial protection and that it is still important to teach their children how to identify a dangerous chat themselves."

Prior work has sought to automatically identify grooming chats, but only after an incidence has already happened in the context of legal prosecution. In this work, we instead investigate this problem from the point of view of prevention. We define and study the task of early sexual predator detection (eSPD) in chats, where the goal is to analyze a running chat from its beginning and predict grooming attempts as early and as accurately as possible. We survey existing datasets and their limitations regarding eSPD, and create a new dataset called PANC for more realistic evaluations. We present strong baselines built on BERT that also reach state-of-the-art results for conventional SPD. Finally, we consider coping with limited computational resources, as real-life applications require eSPD on mobile devices.",
