      "text" : "Relation extraction (RE) aims at predicting the relation between entities based on their context. Several studies have been carried out to handle this crucial and complicated task over decades as the extracted information can serve as a significant role for many downstream tasks. Since the amount of training data generally limits traditional supervised RE systems, current RE systems usually resort to distant supervision (DS) to fetch abundant training data by aligning knowledge bases (KBs) and texts. However, such a heuristic way inevitably introduces some noise to the generated data. Training a robust and unbiased RE system under DS data\n∗ Corresponding author\nnoise becomes the biggest challenge for distantly supervised relation extraction (DSRE).\nWith awareness of the existing DS noise, Zeng et al. (2015) introduces the multi-instance learning (MIL) framework to DSRE by dividing training instances into several bags and using bags as new data units. Regarding the strategy for selecting instances inside the bag, the soft attention mechanism proposed by Lin et al. (2016) is widely used for its better performance than the hard selection method. The ability to form accurate representations from noisy data makes the MIL framework soon become a paradigm of following-up works.\nHowever, we argue that the MIL framework is effective to alleviate data noise for DSRE, but is not data-efficient indeed: As Figure 1 shows: The attention mechanism in the MIL can help select relatively informative instances (e.g.h1, h2) inside the bag, but may ignore the potential information of other abundant instances (e.g.hm). In other words, no matter how many instances a bag contains, only the formed bag-level representation can be used for further training in the MIL, which is quite inefficient. Thus, our focus is on how to make the initial MIL framework efficient enough to leverage all instances while maintaining the ability to obtain an accurate model under DS data noise?\nHere, we propose a contrastive-based method to help the MIL framework learn efficiently. In detail, we regard the initial MIL framework as the bag encoder, which provides relatively accurate representations for different relational triples. Then we develop contrastive instance learning (CIL) to utilize each instance in an unsupervised manner: In short, the goal of our CIL is that the instances sharing the same relational triples (i.e.positive pairs) ought to be close in the semantic space, while the representations of instances with different relational triples (i.e.negative pairs) should be far away.\nExperiments on three public DSRE benchmarks — NYT10 (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), GDS (Jat et al., 2018) and KBP (Ling and Weld, 2012) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework CIL, with consistent improvements over several baseline models and far exceed the state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems. Furthermore, the ablation study shows the rationality of our proposed positive/negative pair construction strategy.\nAccordingly, the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n• We discuss the long-standing MIL framework and point out that it can not effectively utilize abundant instances inside MIL bags.\n• We propose a novel contrastive instance learning method to boost the DSRE model performances under the MIL framework.\n• Evaluation on held-out and human-annotated sets shows that CIL leads to significant improvements over the previous SOTA models."

Following standard practices (Devlin et al., 2019), we add two special tokens to mark the beginning ([CLS]) and the end ([SEP]) of sentences.\nIn BERT, token [CLS] typically acts as a pooling token representing the whole sequence for downstream tasks. However, this pooling representation considers entity tokens e1 and e2 as equivalent to other common word tokens ti, which has been proven (Baldini Soares et al., 2019) to be unsuitable for RE tasks. To encode the sentence in an entity-aware manner, we add four extra special tokens ([H-CLS], [H-SEP]) and ([T-CLS], [T-SEP]) to mark the beginning and the end of two entities.\nPosition Embedding In the Transformer attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), positional encodings are injected to make use of the order of the sequence. Precisely, the learned position embedding has the same dimension as the token embedding so that the two can be summed."

Then the bag representation B̃ can be regarded as an aggregation of all instances’ representations, which is further defined as:\nF([e1, e2, r]) = B̃ = K∑ i=1 αihi\nwhereK is the bag size. As for the choice of weight αi, we follow the soft attention mechanism used in (Lin et al., 2016), where αi is the normalized attention score calculated by a query-based function fi that measures how well the sentence representation hi and the predict relation r matches:\nαi = efi∑ j e fj\nwhere fi = hiAqr, A is a weighted diagonal matrix and qr is the query vector which indicates the representation of relation r (randomly initialized).\nThen, to train such a bag encoder parameterized by θ, a simple fully-connected layer with activation function softmax is added to map the hidden feature vector B̃ to a conditional probability distribution p(r|B̃, θ), and this can be defined as:\np(r|B̃, θ) = e or∑nr\ni=1 e oi\nwhere o = MB̃ + b is the score associated to all relation types, nr is the total number of relations, M is a projection matrix, and b is the bias term.\nAnd we define the objective of bag encoder using cross-entropy function as follows:\nLB(θ) = − ∑ i=1 log p(ri|B̃i, θ)"

A formal description is as follows.\nAssume there is a batch bag input (with a batch size G): (B1, B2, . . . , BG), the relational triples of all bags are different from each other. Each bag B in the batch is constructed by a certain relational triple [e1, e2, r], and all instances x inside the bag satisfy this triple. The representation of the triple can be obtained by bag encoder as B̃.\nWe pick any two bagsBs andBt:t6=s in the batch to further illustrate the process of contrastive instance learning. Bs is defined as the source bag constructed with relational triple [es1, es2, rs] whileBt is the target bag constructed with triple [et1, et2, rt]. And we discuss the positive pair instance and negative pair instances for any instance xs in bag Bs.\nIt is worth noting that all bags are constructed automatically by the distantly supervised method, which extracts relational triples from instances in a heuristic manner and may introduce true/false positive label noise to the generated data. In other words, though the instance x is included in the bag with relational triple [e1, e2, r], it may be noisy and fail to express the relation r."

However, both of the instances xs and xs′ may suffer from data noise, and they are hard to express the same relational triple simultaneously. Thus, taking instance xs and randomly selected instance xs′ as a positive pair is not an optimal option.\nInstance xs ∼ Relational Triple B̃s Another positive pair instance candidate for instance xs is\nthe relational triple representation B̃s of current bag B. Though B̃s can be regarded as a de-noised representation, xs may be still noisy and express other relation r 6= rs. Besides, the quality of constructed positive pairs heavily relies on the model performance of the bag encoder.\nInstance xs ∼ Augmented Instance x∗s From the above analysis, we can see that the general positive pair construction methods often encounter the challenge of DS noise. Here, we propose a noisefree positive pair construction method based on TF-IDF data augmentation: If we only make small and controllable data augmentation to the original instance xs, the augmented instance x∗s should satisfy the same relational triple with instance xs.\nIn detail: (1) We first view each instance as a document and view each word in the instances as a term, then we train a TF-IDF model on the total training corpus. (2) Based on the trained TF-IDF model, we insert/substitute some unimportant (low TF-IDF score, see Figure 6) words to/in instance xs with a specific ratio, and can obtain its augmented instance x∗s. Particularly, special masks are added to entity words to avoid them being substituted."

And the randomly selected instance xt may be too noisy to represent the relational triple of bag Bt, so that the model performance may be influenced.\nInstance xs Relational Triple B̃t Compared to the random selection strategy, using relational triple representation B̃t as the negative pair instance for xs is a better choice to reduce the impact of data noise. As the instance xi can be seen as be far away from a weighted representation∑K\ni=1 αihi of the bag Bt, where all αi are learnable.

(2) The relational triple representations B̃t of other different (t 6= s) bags in the batch are its negative pair instances. The overall schematic diagram of CIL is shown in Figure 9.\nAnd we define the objective for instance xs in\nbag Bs using InfoNCE (Oord et al., 2018) loss:\nLC(xs; θ) = − log esim(hs,h\n∗ s) esim(hs,h∗s) + ∑\nt:t6=s e sim(hs,B̃t)\nwhere sim(a, b) is the function to measure the similarity between two representation vectors a, b, and hs = H(xs), h∗s = H(x∗s) are the sentence representations of instances xs, x∗s.\nBesides, to inherit the ability of language understanding from BERT and avoid catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey and Cohen, 1989), we also add the masked language modeling (MLM) objective to our framework. Pre-text task MLM randomly masks some tokens in the inputs and allows the model to predict the masked tokens, which prompts the model to capture rich semantic information in the contexts. And we denote this objective as LM(θ).\nAccordingly, the total training objective of our contrastive instance learning framework is:\nL(θ) = λ(t) N ∑ B ∑ x∈B LC(x; θ)+LB(θ)+λMLM(θ)\nwhere N = KG is the total number of instances in the batch, λM is the weight of language model objective LM, and λ(t) ⊂ [0, 1] is an increasing function related to the relative training steps t:\nλ(t) = 2\n1 + e−t − 1\nAt the beginning of our training, the value of λ(t) is relatively small, and our framework CIL focuses on obtaining an accurate bag encoder (LB). The value of λ(t) gradually increases to 1 as the relative training steps t increases, and more attention is paid to the contrastive instance learning (LC)."

(2) To prove the MIL can not make full use of sentences, we also train the MIL on sentence bags (MILsent), which repeats each sentence in the training corpus to form a bag3.\n3All the results in Table 4 are obtained under the same test setting that uses MIL bags (i.e.BERT+ATT) as test units.\nFrom Table 4 we can see that: (1) MILbag only resorts to the accurate bag-level representations to train the model and fails to play the role of each instance inside bags; thus, it performs worse than our method CIL (50.8→40.3). (2) Though MILsent can access all training sentences, it loses the advantages of noise reduction in MILbag (40.3→30.6). The noisy label supervision may wrongly guide model training, and its model performance heavily suffers from DS data noise (86.0→63.3). (3) Our framework CIL succeeds in leveraging abundant instances while retaining the ability to denoise.\nTo validate the rationality of our proposed positive/negative pair construction strategy, we also conduct an ablation study on three variants of our framework CIL. We denote these variants as: CILrandpos: Randomly select an instance xs′ also from bag Bs as the positive pair instance for xs. CILbagpos: Just take the relational triple representation B̃s as the positive pair instance for xs. CILrandneg: Randomly select an instance xt from another bag Bt as the negative pair instance for xs.\nAnd we summarize the model performances of our CIL and other three variants in Table 5.\nAs the previous analysis in section 2.4, the three variants of our CIL framework may suffer from DS noise: (1) Both variants CILrandpos and CILbagpos may construct noisy positive pairs; therefore, their model performances have a little drop (50.8→49.2, 50.8→47.8). Besides, the variant CILbagpos also relies on the bag encoder, for which it performs worse than the variant CILrandpos (49.2→47.8).

      "text" : "Our work is related to DSRE, pre-trained language models, and recent contrastive learning methods.\nDSRE Traditional supervised RE systems heavily rely on the large-scale human-annotated dataset, which is quite expensive and time-consuming. Distant supervision is then introduced to the RE field, and it aligns training corpus with KB facts to generate data automatically. However, such a heuristic process results in data noise and causes classical supervised RE models hard to train. To solve this issue, Lin et al. (2016) applied the multi-instance learning framework with selective attention mechanism over all instances, and it helps RE models learn under DS data noise. Following the MIL framework, recent works improve DSRE models from many different aspects: (1) Yuan et al. (2019) adopted relation-aware attention and constructed super bags to alleviate the problem of bag label error. (2) Ye et al. (2019) analyzed the label distribution of dataset and found the shifted label problem that significantly influences the performance of DSRE models. (3) Vashishth et al. (2018) employed Graph Convolution Networks (Defferrard et al., 2016) to encode syntactic information from the text and improves DSRE models with additional side information from KBs. (4) Alt et al.\n(2019) extended the GPT to the DSRE, and finetuned it to achieve SOTA model performance.\nPre-trained LM Recently pre-trained language models achieved great success in the NLP field. Vaswani et al. (2017) proposed a self-attention based architecture — Transformer, and it soon becomes the backbone of many following LMs. By pre-training on a large-scale corpus, BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) obtains the ability to capture a notable amount of “common-sense” knowledge and gains significant improvements on many tasks following the fine-tune scheme. At the same time, GPT (Radford et al., 2018), XL-Net (Yang et al., 2019) and GPT2 (Radford et al., 2019) are also well-known pre-trained representatives with excellent transfer learning ability. Moreover, some works (Radford et al., 2019) found that considerably increasing the size of LM results in even better generalization to downstream tasks.\nContrastive Learning As a popular unsupervised method, contrastive learning aims to learn representations by contrasting positive pairs against negative pairs (Hadsell et al., 2006; Oord et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020). Wu et al. (2018) proposed to use the non-parametric instance-level discrimination to leverage more information in the data samples. Our approach, however, achieves the goal of data-efficiency in a more complicated MIL setting: instead of contrasting the instance-level information during training, we find that instance-bag negative pair is the most effective method, which constitutes one of our main contributions. In the NLP field, Dai and Lin (2017) proposed to use contrastive learning for image caption, and Clark et al. (2020) trained a discriminative model for language representation learning. Recent literature (Peng et al., 2020) has also attempted to relate the contrastive pre-training scheme to classical supervised RE task. Different from our work, Peng et al. (2020) aims to utilize abundant DS data and help classical supervised RE models learn a better relation representation, while our CIL focuses on learning an effective and efficient DSRE model under DS data noise."

For the past decade, researchers apply the multiinstance learning (MIL) framework to find the most reliable feature from a bag of sentences. Although the pattern of MIL bags can greatly reduce DS noise, it fails to represent many other useful sentence features in the datasets. In many cases, these sentence features can only be acquired by extra sentence-level human annotation with heavy costs. Therefore, the performance of distantly supervised RE models is bounded. In this paper, we go beyond typical MIL framework and propose a novel Contrastive Instance Learning (CIL) framework. Specifically, we regard the initial MIL as the relational triple encoder and constraint positive pairs against negative pairs for each instance. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, with significant improvements over the previous methods on NYT10, GDS and KBP.",
