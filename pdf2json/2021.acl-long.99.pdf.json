      "text" : "Modeling the behavior of legislators is one of the most important topics of quantitative political science. Existing researches largely rely on roll call data, i.e. historical voting records, to estimate the political preference of legislators. The most widely used approach for roll call data analysis is ideal point model (Clinton et al., 2004) that represents legislators and legislation as points in a one-dimension latent space. Researchers enhance ideal point model by incorporating textual information of legislation (Gerrish and Blei, 2011; Gu\n∗Corresponding author.\net al., 2014; Kraft et al., 2016) and report positive results for roll call vote prediction.\nAlthough roll call data is the major resource for legislator behavior modeling, it has two limitations. Firstly, it fails to uncover detailed opinions of legislators towards legislative issues. Therefore, we have no clue about the motivation behind their voting. Secondly, it is unable to model the behavior of newly-elected legislators because their historical voting records are not available (i.e., coldstart problem). Meanwhile, researchers explore to use public statements to characterize the ideology of legislators with the guidance of framing theory (Entman, 1993; Chong and Druckman, 2007; Baumer et al., 2015; Vafa et al., 2020). Vafa et al. (2020) propose a text-based ideal point model to analyze tweets of legislators independent of roll call data. Experiment results show some correlations between distributions of ideal points learned\nfrom legislative data and public statements. However, they treat the two resources separately and fail to uncover deep relationships of behavior between these two landscapes.\nFigure 1 shows a legislative issue related to prohibit partial-birth abortion. It includes the title and description of the legislation, roll call vote records and public statements on Twitter of legislators. Based on the voting records, we know the stance of legislators. With the discussion on Twitter, we can further understand their opinions towards the topic. Supporters concentrate on protecting the life while opponents emphasize rights of choice. This motivates that bridging public statements on Twitter with roll call data can provide a full image of behavior patterns of legislators.\nA closer look at the example (Figure 1) reveals that most tweets utilize hashtags to express ideas in short. Moreover, people with opposite stances choose different groups of hashtags, i.e., supporters use #life and #TheyFeelPain while opponents use #Choice and #WhatWomenWant. Further analysis on a large tweets dataset, where each tweet is processed by a python library TextBlob1, shows that most hashtags are polarized with one sentiment (Figure 2a). Based on this observation and previous studies that reveal polarization of hashtags (Conover et al., 2011a; Garimella and Weber, 2017), we explore to utilize hashtags as a label to describe the preferences of legislators on public discussion and propose a novel task of hashtag usage prediction to characterize their ideology.\nIn this paper, we collect public statements of legislators on Twitter as an extension of roll call data for legislator representation learning. Our intuition is to combine roll call votes as hard labels and hashtags as soft labels to jointly model legislators. In practice, we build a heterogeneous graph to bridge the voting behavior and public statements of legislators. It consists of three kinds of nodes, legislators, legislation and hashtags in tweets. Subsequently, we employ a heterogeneous Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) to simultaneously update the representation of different nodes. Two tasks are used for training, including roll call vote prediction and hashtag usage prediction to model the behavior of legislators on voting and on public statements respectively. The major contributions of this paper are threefold:\n1https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob\n- To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study incorporating both voting behavior and public statements to jointly depict legislators. The proposed framework enables us to understand the preferences of legislators combining their behavior in legislative process and on public platforms.\n- We propose to learn the representation of legislation and legislators using heterogeneous graph which can densify relations among legislators, thus mitigate the cold-start problem.\n- We propose a novel task of hashtag usage prediction to characterize the preferences of legislators on public discussion and construct a dataset as the benchmark. Our dataset and code is available on Github 2."

For dataset construction, we first extract Twitter accounts of legislators from their homepages on the website of U.S. Congress 3. For those who have not provided Twitter account, we manually search their names on Twitter, and identify their accounts by checking the verification information and biography. In this way, 735 accounts of legislators are included in our extended dataset. We crawl all tweets (before July 20th, 2020) for each legislator remained via twitterscraper 4. In addition to this, we also collect their following list.\nWe show some statistics of the dataset in Figure 2. Figure 2b presents the distribution of the amount of tweets posted by year. It shows that legislators pay increasing attention to Twitter from year 2009 to 2017. Legislators post 3,071 tweets on average and 57.82% of legislators post more than 2,000 times. In terms of hashtag, a third of tweets contain at least one hashtag with 82,381 unique hashtags in total. Figure 2c indicates that most hashtags fade away within three months. Figure 2d shows the distribution of the length of hashtags, illustrating a hashtag usually consists of a few words. In order to reduce noise, we keep hashtags with length greater than 2 and frequency higher than 50. After that, 2,057 hashtags are reserved for graph construction.\nTo explore hashtag usage behavior, we construct 0-1 labels indicating whether a legislator has posted a specific hashtag or not. Considering some hashtags are not popular, we further remove those posted by less than 100 legislators, for hashtag\n3www.congress.gov 4https://github.com/bisguzar/twitter-scraper\nusage prediction.

Obviously, more legislation two legislators have collaborated on means they are more alike ideologically. We follow this setup and regard the number of legislation two legislators have co-sponsored as weight of this relation to measure strength of the relationship between congressmen. In this way, a legislator network can be constructed and we obtain an adjacency matrix A, with each element aij\nrepresenting the number of legislation mi and mj have co-sponsored. R2: Similarity of Legislation Both topic models and embedding paradigms have been incorporated to model legislation in previous studies. However, the semantic relations among legislation have not been explicitly considered. We explore to better learn legislation representation by incorporating these semantic relationships. To achieve this goal, we construct a network of legislation, and use semantic similarity to link two legislation. Specifically, an adjacency matrix B is computed, with each element bij denoting the number of common words in texts of legislation li and lj . R3: Co-occurrence of Hashtags If two hashtags are mentioned together frequently, it’s likely that they bear similar ideas, such as #dreamact and #protectdreamers.

Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) (Kipf and Welling, 2017) provide an efficient way to perform message propagation and aggregation. In the propagation phase, nodes send signals to their neighbors while in the aggregation phase, each node sums up messages from its neighbors and updates its representation. When there are only one type of relations, the layerwise rule of GCNs is:\nH(l+1) = σ ( ÂH(l)W (l) ) (1)\nwhere H(l) is hidden representation of lth layer, Â represents the adjusted adjacency matrix and W (l) is weight matrix shared by all edges in layer l, σ(·)represents the activation function. For each node i with neighbors Ni, the update rule can be described as:\nh (l+1) i = σ ∑ j∈Ni 1 ci W (l)h (l) j  (2) where ci represents the normalization item, which is often set to |Ni| when each neighbor has equal importance.\nRGCNs generalize GCNs to deal with relations of different types. RGCNs utilize different weight matrixes and normalization factors for different relation types. Thus, the hidden representation for each node i in layer (l + 1) can be computed as:\nh (l+1) i = σ ∑ r∈R ∑ j∈N ri 1 ci,r W (l)r h (l) j +W (l) 0 h (l) i  (3) whereR is the set of relation types, and N ri is the set of neighbors of node i connected by relation type r. Since each neighbor has different degrees of importance in our graph, we compute the normalization factor ci,r according to weights of relations we have obtained, instead of using ci,r = |N ri |. We apply 2-layer RGCNs to capture 2nd order relations between nodes empirically. After convolution, we get representations of legislator, legislation and hashtag, denoted as Rm, Rl and Rt."

We use two configurations to form the experimental dataset. (1) random: We set up an in-session experiment environment following Kornilova et al. (2018); Davoodi et al. (2020), where records of each two-year session is considered as an independent experiment set. This results in 4 experiment sets. For each set, 20% legislation is selected for testing, 20% is for validation and the rest is for training. (2) time-based: We set up a time-based environment following Yang et al. (2020). We form an experiment set with two consecutive sessions and use the former one for training and validation and the latter one for testing respectively. This results in 3 experiment sets. In this setting, some legislators might appear in the testing session only. Therefore, we report results of two settings. For Mem Train, we only include legislators appearing in training set for testing. For Mem All, we include all legislators in test set.\nImplementation Details The dimensions of initial legislative representations are 64, 768 and 768 for legislator, legislation and hashtag respectively. We randomly choose 50 tweets to encode each hashtag. When modeling relations, we set a threshold as the mean value for each type of relations, and only\nreserve those with weights greater than the threshold, to eliminate noise. We use 2-layer RGCNs and the sizes of hidden layers are 128 and 64. A batch normalization layer is added after initializing representation. The batch size is 128 and learning rate is 1× 10−4. Dropout and early stopping strategies are adopted to prevent the model from over-fitting. For hyperparameters of three losses, we simply set λ1 = λ2 = 10λ3 to control three losses within the same order of magnitude. For graph construction, the entity set covers all entities involved in and before that year while the relation set only covers information before that year to avoid future information leakage.\nModels for Comparison We compare our model with some state-of-the-art approaches.\n- majority is a baseline which assumes all legislators vote yea.\n- ideal-point-wf (Gerrish and Blei, 2011): a regression model that takes the word frequency of legislation text as features. The training paradigm follows the traditional ideal point model.

CNN+meta and LSTM+GCN achieve better results than other baselines. This proves that introducing background information is helpful to capture general preferences.\n- All models perform worse in time-based setting compared to random setting. The performance drop of ideal-point based models that incorporate textual information is the largest. This indicates that ideal-point based models have difficulty for transfer learning from one session to another.\n- Comparing the setting of Mem Train and Mem All, we find that most methods have difficulty modeling new-elected legislators. Models incorporating background knowledge perform more stable, among which our model is the most robust one.\nHashtag Usage Prediction For hashtag usage prediction, we evaluate our model in time-based setting. For comparison, we employ a simple FFNN to process initial embeddings of legislators and hashtags for label prediction. Experiment results show that our model achieves better performance than FFNN in terms of both accuracy (80.44% vs 80.03%) and macro F1 (61.34% vs\n53.93%). This indicates that it’s difficult to predict preferences on hashtags of legislators based on textual information only. Incorporating legislative information, our model achieves improvements, especially for macro F1.

We set a threshold to filter noise. Different thresholds indicate different degrees of polarization, where 0.5 means using all hashtag labels in our dataset (the setting of our model in Table 1), and 0.8 represents the ratio of major sentiment in tweets of the hashtag must exceed 0.8. Figure 4a presents the results. The performance increases when the threshold increases from 0.5 to 0.7, indicating hashtags without firm attitudes would hurt the performance. After that, the performance drops because of the reduction of data. However, due to the chance of hashtag hijacking strategy where a hashtag is deliberately taken up and used by “the other side”(Hadgu et al., 2013), noise in hashtags can not be completely eliminated in this way."

We compute hashtag valence proposed by Conover et al. (2011a) and aggregate hashtags a legislator has posted to get hashtag valence for him or her. Since DW-NOMINATE scores are not comparable across chambers, Figure 5a and Figure 5b show conditions for legislators involved in the 115th session of House and Senate respectively. The figures and correlation(r(529) = 0.80 p < 0.001 for House and r(135) = 0.74 p < 0.001 for Senate) not only indicate that most legislators are polarized similarly in tweeting and voting, but also again illustrate that some legislators voting similarly on average can be hugely different in their languages. Complex similarities and differences of legislators like this can not be expressed by representation learned from votes or tweets separately.\nBesides overall leaning inference, inconsistency at the level of individual bills is also worthy of attention. When predicting on 113S2223, a bill for “an increase in the Federal minimum wage”, the vote-based model predicts that Senator Harry Reid will vote nay, which is also the ground truth. But our model wrongly predicts that he will vote yea. We probe into his tweets and find that he\nused #raisethewage frequently to call for raise in minimum wage, as those who support the bill. On the one hand, hashtags may have difficulty capturing more fine-grained decisions, which can be influenced by various factors; on the other hand, legislators may behave differently from what they say, since they may make certain statements to get public support (Spell et al., 2020). When legislators do not accord their words to deed, our model may be misled by legislators’ statements. As it’s difficult to find hashtags directly and accurately related to a specific bill in an automatic and complete way, we will explore the frequency of inconsistency in the future."

      "text" : "Ideal point estimation has become a mainstream approach to model ideology of legislators. Classical ideal point model (Clinton et al., 2004) represents both legislators and legislation in the same space, and voting behavior is characterized as the distance between them. However, this simple spatial model fails to predict votes on new legislation. Text-based models have emerged to address this issue. Gerrish and Blei (2011, 2012); Gu et al. (2014); Nguyen et al. (2015) extended ideal point model with latent topics and issue-adjusted methods. Some embedding methods (Kraft et al., 2016) also promote learning of legislators. More recently, external context information including party, sponsor and donors (Kornilova et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020; Davoodi et al., 2020) have been introduced to better describe the legislative process.\nSince votes are not the only way to express political preferences, other sources of data including speech and knowledge graph (Budhwar et al., 2018; Gentzkow et al., 2019; Patil et al., 2019; Vafa et al., 2020) have been applied to estimate ideology. Although previous studies (Bruns and Highfield, 2013; Golbeck and Hansen, 2014; Barberá, 2015; Peng et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2016; Boutyline and Willer, 2017; Johnson et al., 2017) have incorporated social network of following or retweeting on Twitter to learn legislators, fine-grained attitudes of legislators remain unknown since the texts themselves have not been mined. Until recently, Preoţiuc-Pietro et al. (2017) started to analyze linguistic differences between ideologically different groups using a broad range of handcrafted language features, and studies (Vafa et al., 2020; Spell et al., 2020) explored to incorporate Twitter texts to cap-\nture nuances in legislators’ preferences via statistical methods. In spite of this, there has been little research attempting to combine votes with public statements to portray legislators from both angles and predict their behavior.\nPrevious studies (Conover et al., 2011b; Small, 2011; Bruns and Stieglitz, 2012; Cohen and Ruths, 2013) have suggested that modeling on hashtag metadata is an informative way to analyze tweets, yielding classification of political affiliations. Since hashtag is an important mean for people to participate in political discussion and communication, hashtag usage pattern has also been modeled as feature vectors in many clustering tasks to help learn different user groups (Conover et al., 2011a; Bode et al., 2013, 2015). Hemphill et al. (2013) and Yang et al. (2016) have analyzed hashtag usage patterns of different ideologies through feature selection and keyword statistics. However, hashtag usage can be further utilized based on these analyses, e.g., for prediction tasks. Thus, we focus on hashtags to depict statements of legislators on Twitter, to jointly estimate their political preferences."

In the future, we aim to conduct more research on the stance modeling of legislators."

It represents legislators and legislation as points in a latent space and shows promising results for modeling voting behavior. However, it fails to capture more specific attitudes of legislators toward emerging issues and is unable to model newly-elected legislators without voting histories. In order to mitigate these two problems, we explore to incorporate both voting behavior and public statements on Twitter to jointly model legislators. In addition, we propose a novel task, namely hashtag usage prediction to model the ideology of legislators on Twitter. In practice, we construct a heterogeneous graph for the legislative context and use relational graph neural networks to learn the representation of legislators with the guidance of historical records of their voting and hashtag usage. Experiment results indicate that our model yields significant improvements for the task of roll call vote prediction. Further analysis further demonstrates that legislator representation we learned captures nuances in statements.",
